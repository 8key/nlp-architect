"-Fantastic! -Been meaning to visit Elliot's for ages, its either closed or full every time I have tried to go in the past. -Being January and lunchtime it was quiet on the day we eventually managed to visit - but still with a buzzy atmosphere. -Relaxed an"
Have been there on many occasions and the menu has a great choice of well cooked and presented food. Staff are friendly and helpful.
"I don't have much positive to say about the Pret a Manger in Westferry Circus, The food is as expected of the chain but being served is a nightmare! Long ques and the counter staff are over friendly which to be honest, I just want to pop in and get my food and leave! Suffice to say that the smiles are on the wrong side of the counter! To top this, they have now split the tills which if you chose the wrong line, you'll be waiting even longer! There is good customer service but i feel it's a little too much and casues longer waiting times compared to the other prets in Canary Wharf."
"Food really nice, shame you seem to always have to queue to get in even tough half the tables are empty. Takes an age to get a drink when you finally are seated.Need more heaters for such a cold outdoor/indoor location. It's cold...Food choice is limited, really nice pizza...although we were give five bowls to eat it out of as 'that was all (she) could find'. Weird."
"What a meh place. A chef who seems to be seasoning-phobic - bland liver, ricotta, squash, croquettes and risotto balls. (Although smoked salmon/beetroot/horseradish was a redeeming trinity.) over-hyped and under-salted."
"Came once before for an afternoon as part of a Hen Party, enjoyed this and decided to treat my husband to the Gentlemans Afternoon Tea, very disappionting. The hot dishes were very nice however the scones were overcooked and flat. To make things worse the Hotel Management team decided to have a meeting in the lounge for about 6 managers a few tables away and all we could hear was their meeting about charging, etc. managers coming and going with coffees and walking around eating food. The saviour was our waiter from Portugal, he was great."
"My first ever review, but felt compelled. Not because this restaurant is bad, but because I cannot fathom all the 5* reviews for such an overwhelmingly average restaurant.Service: We went on Valentine's day and the staff struggled with the number of covers, but just coped. Service was fairly inattentive as our bottle of wine was forgotten and our mains Arrived before we had any cutlery. Staff were apologetic about this and brought the necessary right away; they were polite but nothing more. Not bad; definitely not good: average.Food: Acceptable but nowhere near met expectations. Just about worth the money paid.- Deep-fried goat's cheese was dry with a bland, sugary, red syrup that was probably supposed to be cranberry; calamari were overcooked and a bit rubbery but acceptable. To be expected in a run-of-the-mill Italian; not one with as many glowing reviews as on this site.- Chicken escalope was well-cooked but accompanying potatoes were a little greasy and veg was just boiled veg; can't understand 5* for this! Calzone would have been good if the tomato sauce served over it wasn't stone cold. Suspect this was just oversight as they were busy. Didn't ruin it as the pizza itself was hot and filling was ok.Overall: Acceptable but wouldn't consider going back when there are at least two Italian restaurants within spitting distance that are in a completely different league. It's not bad, but 5* and the 47th best restaurant in the whole of London?! Totally incomprehensible."
"Nice location inside crowded Covent Garden, so if you're looking for a quite place this is probably not the right location for you.I was there with a friend and it didn't take long until we got a table. We had to wait for our food quite a while, but my steak was really delicious. The open kitchen offers some interesting glances on other dishes."
"Great portions sizes and prices are decent too. Food was excellent and would definitely come here again, staff were also friendly and attentive"
"I went to Hawksmoor and really liked the simple atmosphere, listening to people chatting and eating. The personnel was friendly and efficient, and the food (I took the fillet, with sauce bearnaise) was heavenly. Same thing applies to their cocktails. A great experience, to enjoy great tastes in a simple way."
"We came across this Pub after a long day of sight seeing. The food was good , the drinks were cold and the staff were very friendly. We will definitely be back."
I nearly go to Zaibatsu everyday for my lunch. The price is quite reasonable and you can taste very authentic Asian food here. The staffs are really friendly as they will do their best to meet your need. Strong recommend this restaurant.ÀªŒ¨¦Ž_Œ_ÉŠÈáŒÈää©__•_ÎŠüÏ´ÀŽ_ŒüüŒ´_ŒÄ•_ÎŒÔ÷Œá´Š¼¼ŽÄ_Ž_ŒüüŒ´_‹ÛâŒ_â¾_ÏŠ_Ê¾÷øŒÏ¬¾Ê_¾_ÑŒ¡_¾_È¾ÑÉ¾üü¾öÐÛÉŒá´Š_Ï•_Î¾öÔŠ__Œ_¼Äö¾_¬ÀªŒ¨¦Ž_Œ_É‹ÛâŒÝÊŠü¼Àª¾÷ø¾Ê_¾_ÑŒ¡_¾_ÈŒÎ¼ŒÙÙ¾öÔŒ_ÈÀà_ã¾ÏÛŒ´__ã¾Ñ´¾Ðª•_öŠ¼_¾«_Ž£_ŒÔ_•_äŽ_Œ_É‹Ûâ
"Situated in the middle of covent garden, this restaurant with Jamie Oliver's name to it looked like the hive of activeity. We were greeted and seated by a very friendly waiter. The menu seemed ok, but there wasn't a GF menus choice, which I found disappointing as thought Jamie was a modern chief. I didn't let this deter me, and asked the waiter what my choices would be. I was offered a salad. I asked if I could have the pork chop with out the sauce, which sounded lovely, he said yes they could do that for me. I was very happy at that. A second waitress came to take our order where I was told while I could have the pork I couldn't have the sauce, the cabbage that it came with or the chips. So pork chop and potatoes it was. Outside of the salad there was nothing else Gluten free. When my meal Arrived, several minutes after my partners Pizza, it Arrived dressed with sauce and cabbage. After enquiring I was told it was all gluten free !!!!! I have to say my meal was far more tasty than my partners pizza. Not a place I would recommend for ceoliac's to try and definitely not value for money."
"I came here accidentally on NYE, as I had booked a table at ""Mae Ping Thai"", but didn't realise they were different restaurants!Silly mistake, but it worked out in my favour, as there was plenty more on the menu. From the point that we Arrived, staff were very friendly, polite and welcoming. We ordered a selection of starters including dumplings, satay, ribs and chicken spring rolls. All were lovely, however the spring rolls didn't have much taste and were quite empty, which was quite disappointing. Mains were delicious. Full of flavour and good portion size. The food tasted fresh and was served very hot, so we were all satisfied with our meals. The price was reasonable, particularly considering that it was NYE. It was approximately £22 for a two course meal with sides, and a glass of alcohol. So great value for money."
"We went to Ibleo for my Son's 21st birthday meal and it was everything we could have wanted and more. The hospitality, quality of food and friendliness of the staff all added up to make a very memorable evening. Highly recommend the Scallops with Bacon, but everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal. Very large portions, excellent value for money."
"This place was just awful. We came in without any research because we were hungry, and left totally disappointed.The kids had to order a second meal each as the kids meal wasn't nearly enough for them. I had the pork on cabbage which was tasteless. My wife's cauliflower dish was the only one that was decent. The waitress didn't tell us that only certain drinks were included in the kid's meals so let them order off-menu. The Margaret pizza was dreary and had the consistency of a crepe. The icecream was nice though - homemade flavours and served in a chilled cupola.Maybe we were paying for the location but I couldn't see it. It felt like the middle of an old shopping mall with no atmosphere and overpriced, bad quality food. Absolutely avoid."
Freindy staff good food reasonably priced you can't go wrong here .just right for a pleasant walk around the marina after as well
"Firstly, friendly staff .Cool decor with seating in the basement. The food was good and value for money , thanks to the staff for making it a nice experience"
The Park Terrace never fails to deliver. Brilliant food from a menu that caters for all tastes. Excellent attentive service always with a smile that makes the evening a great delight. Special mention must go to Daniel for whom nothing is too much trouble. He will always take the time to advise on wine and have a little chat to make everyone feel special.
"Had an early evening meal here for our anniversary. It was excellent. The best service we have ever had in London - all the staff were pleasant and helpful and certainly not over fussy. Food and drink were great too, good choice , good portion size and lovely presentation. Had a cocktail as part of the Travelzoo offer, made the night feel special from the start. So, thanks, we'd book again without hesitation."
The waiter was so kind and friendly as he served us before the 100 or so students that had just Arrived. The food was as is always at any Bella Italia consistently tasty and enjoyable. Ideal position on the Strand opposite The Adelphi Theatre.where we had just been.
"Dinner for 4 on the occasion of my birthday in December. As you would hope from a restaurant in this location, the service was faultless and the food as good as it always in a Cote Brasserie.I had steak tartare followed by sea bass which were both excellent. My dessert then came with a side-order of embarrassment as my girlfriend decided to tell them it was my birthday. They stuck a candle in my cheese(!) and ALL the waiting staff came and sang ""happy birthday"". Grrrr!!!!"
"The breakfast and the Dinner was very good. The breakfast was lovely served. Our Dinner was Asian -we love Asian Food- and it tasted very good. Our room was very nice. Lovely designed, very clean, gorgeous bathroom, comfortable bed. We would recommend the hotel. 5 minutes to go there is the Subway Farrington. Also near the Hotel there's a little supermarket and some Cafes."
"Strada is one of my favourite chains in Londen. No nonsense italian food. Here we had very friendly waiters, so a very pleasant meal in a good atmosphere"
"We Arrived in the green pea after a silly walk along the thames. Normally dinner is not served on monday but the waitress told us the chef wanted to prepare something for us. A moment later the chef himself sat down on our table to explain the meals he could prepare for us. Very charming men, we loved the fresh home-made pies, the children loved the home-made chicken wings! Very reasonable price"
We were impressed by the friendly and efficient service at this restaurant. We only wanted a quick meal to share but were welcomed and our order was taken quickly. The meal was just what we needed - it is a recipe I have made myself by jamie Oliver.
"Just down the street from the Sherlock Holmes Museum, a hearty pizza was just what we needed on a cold day. The price was right and the service and food very good."
"We booked a table for lunch, but were being told by the staff our table was not available and that we had to wait at the end of the queue for 45 min. The staff was really not helpful and did not care at all."
"We came for the Bookatable offer: cocktail and 3 courses for £30. I had the Tom and Jerez cocktail (yes, it does include sherry!), smoked salmon starter (thick cut and succulent), 35 day aged rump steak with triple-cooked chips (perfect steak - slightly charred on the outside and pink in the middle) and passionfruit cheesecake to finish (deconstructed, so more interesting than just a slice of cheesecake). It was all delicious, and portion sizes were good. And although they specialise in steak, other options are available including fish and vegetarian. There is a good wine list with a wide range available by the glass, though tending to be a bit pricey. Service was very friendly from the moment we Arrived and throughout the meal. The restaurant is below street level, so no natural light, but the dining room is spacious, with soft, warm lighting and an art-deco feel."
"We went there on Sunday night without much expectations and were so thrilled we did! All the people working there were so friendly and let us try a lot of samples, we loved the ice cream, it is one of the best I have tried in London! The French stand also offers great cheese and charcuterie boards and I couldn't resist buying cheese and salami at a great price!! Will return asap with a lot of friends to do an Italian aperitiveo :)"
"It was my first time at Nando`s and I loved every bit of it. The menu may seem small but there is quite a bit of selection. What is great is that you can choose how hot you want your food to be, so it is quite convenient. What still makes it feel like a fast food place is the fact that you have to go place your order on your own, a waiter does not come to you. Be sure to get the bottomless drink option, they had a great selection in the drink fountain, so it is definitely worth it. Other than that, just enjoy the food!"
On arriveal at St Pancras we decided to have a cup of tea / coffee before visiting London. The staff were so pleasant and helpful and made the experience a lovely experienceOn departing from London some 3 days later we also decided to have a drink. The waitress was the same as the previous occasion and she remembered us which with the number she must have served in between we thought was mnarvellous
Sure it's a chain but when you live in London you know how terrible the coffee almost always is at one off coffe-shops and those terrible placed Nero and Costa. So Pret is a great option - great service by London standards. Very quick and good prices. Food is very good too. Highly recommended!
"From start to end the food was simply put sublime.Even the bread was fantastic.The staff are super attentive but not in your face , just the right amount and level of service to ensure they are there when needed .We had 3 amuse bouche that were diveine then the most superb sour dough bread followed by a delicious turbot ,my wife had a sensational lamb dish and pre -desert that was smashing and a desert of brown sugar tart with stem ginger ice cream that was close to good enough to leave home for.The wine menu was vast and the whisky menu was adequate....with a little pleasant upside of a 26 yr pappy van winkel- what a find!"
"Perfect spot for a brunch with friends. The menu items look small but the prix Fixe menu was a great deal at £23. Watch out for the water costs and the tidy addition they make to the bill. We were chased away from our table once the allotted 2 hour slot was up - to the minute - must be a popular place. Given the location and the typically brilliant Mandarin service, highly recommended. Delicious."
"ive had a nice time at this place! nice burger, fresh beer and very polite staff. Strongly recommended."
"We have been a few times. The food is good - interesting and well cooked. The wine list is fascinating. The set up, shared tables, a dynamic menu written up on the wall, the tapas bar area - its all very Brooklyn NYC.Some menu items are not so strong: the jamon, for example, and it seems that the most intriguing dishes run out very quickly. One of the waiters walks up and scrubs a dish off the wall.Not everyone is happy with the achingly obvious trendiness of the place. The wine prices are very high and some wines are perhaps a bit too quirky for their own good. (As with people didn't want to drink it). Spaces are often time-limited and almost everyone is obliged to share space with other parties.We are still not quite sure."
"I visited Villa Bianca for midweek lunch.My last two visits had been disappointing and pricey for the fayre on offer.However this time I was pleased that this long established Italian had really improved. The quality and presentation of the food really was very good. So much so that whilst there, I made a reservation for a forthcoming Saturday night - hopefully it will be equally enjoyable!"
We did book a table and they gave us a whole area.Nice drinks and great music. Will be back soon. Definitely worth a visit.
Welcomed in by front of house like a member of the family true Italian warmth. It was late so the kitchen was closing which was pointed out but we knew what we wanted so it wasn't a problem . The oxtail tortelli was fantastic with a lovely sauce . My wife had the tagliatelle which again was great . I was pushed towards the fatalone red wine which at £13.50 was perfect with my food . Try the tiramisu with a glass of vintage de glace .....you won't be disappointed !I'm short the staff were lovely and very friendly the prices for this part of London are reasonable and the interior is calm and clean . Will go again when in the area .
"I went there because assortment of pastry and sandwiches. The quality is good and reasonable price. If need quick food or coffee , go to Pret a manger"
"Excelent food, Excelent workers!Its the best restaurant in the zone, We really enjoy it!Don't dude in try it!"
"I had lunch several times at this restaurant, and found the food to be very fresh, good quality and reasonable in price. A good place for family, and casual dining."
We've had a wonderful evening here. It's a casual place with nice and friendly staff. The atmosphere was good and had a real Mexican vibe. With the right music and decorations.The food is good and isn't expensive. You can have your meal including 2 drinks for under £ 20.It definitely a place we'll return when commune back to London.
We were taken there for lunch last Sunday. Lovely old fashioned surroundings and helpful staff. I don't like writing bad reviews but this is an exception.I could not swallow the roast beef which was embarrasing. Like old boot leather.The soup was an unpleasant thick gooey tasteless mess. The best part of the meal were the Yorkshire puds. Will NOT be returning.
Arrived on a Thursday evening.Was served by a great waiter who seem to be doing every table! Our starter Arrived in good time (pulled pork) recommend.However our mains took some time to arrive.The decor of the restaurant was vibrant and funky and adds to the overall atmosphere.The cocktail are some of the best in london and not too overpriced.Would definitely recommend if only for the customer service which seems to be of a very high standard.
"Was here for a work party and it was a lively and enjoyable place to be. The food was of a good quality and was fresh, with the cocktails etc being varied to suit all tastes. I did however find the bouncers a little annoying, as they kept telling us to move back from the side of the road so people could walk past - although we wasn't blocking the entire pavement, the irony being that they were blocking the pavement coming to tell us off! It didn't spoil the evening and we all enjoyed."
Maria and Enrico were fantastic helping with my son's 6th birthday party for 25 very excited boys! They were kind and patient and really charming with all the boys and parents. It made it very stress free and easy for me. Beaufort House is a great venue for kids' parties. The whole experience was super. We all had a really happy day :) thank you so much to Maria and Enrico and the Beaufort House team!
"we were recommended this place and were not let down.Good food at very reasonable prices and even being a Friday night we were not rushed we sat down at 7.00 and left at 9.30 .There was a good atmosphere and it also looked child friendly, waiters were good and nothing was to much trouble we would definitely go back"
"I recently ate lunch at Banh Mi Bay, and had an overall excellent experience. The service was quick and friendly, the food was very delicious, and seemingly of a very high quality, and the prices were beyond reasonable. Highly recommended."
"After hearing such wonderful things about the place that we thought we should check it out. Being a local ourselves as we are known around the area with great relations with them all. Unfortunately when we Arrived we were ignored the whole time, no eye contact, no hello, we felt completely invisible! My husband works for a very high end company and he was shocked at such a poor level of customer service, I was so close to walking out! He asked them if we could get some drinks and cakes. Finally someone came to serve us. It has left a very bad poor impression and we have great friends who goes there often with their children. Can't wait to tell them about our appalling service, bad service gets bad word of mouth! Plus overrated and overpriced!"
"You have to visit here when out in Hoxton Square. Went with some mates and were promptly seated. Great cosy feel to the place (somewhat rustic) and the drinks were spectacular and bar staff friendly. Worth mentioning that the music was good not blasting, prices reasonable versus quality.Would visit again, and you should come if you haven't."
ive tasted a lot of fish and chips around the UK and for me this is probably the best fish and chips you can try.* Best dish: For me the best option is the (fresh) cod.* Service: Quite good and attentive. Very open to criticism.* Price: Around 18£ (main course+soft drink)It's more expensive than the usual fish and chips but it really worth it.Because of these reasons this is one of my favourite restaurants in Europe.
I met with some friends for dinner and decided to give this place a go. Ok. From the outside I was a bit unsure of it as it looked pretty full when we Arrived and was quite small. However we only had to wait 5 minutes for a table and we were able to promptly give our order.I ordered the vegetarian spring rolls for starters and the garlic chicken for mains and both dishes exceeded my expectations. Both were full of excellent flavouring and of excellent taste and the staff working there were very helpful towards our needs. I would most definitely come here again just to try out some of the other dishes as for a Thai Restaurant in London it is very well reasonably priced
"After reading all the reviews and knowing we were to be in Greenwich for lunchtime decided to check the place out.Well the reviews are spot on, welcomed by Tom and told to sit down in his own lovely style!After Tom describing in detail what was on offer (no menus as mentioned in other reviews) we ordered Steak & Chicken pies and mash/gravy with the veg option and we were not dissapointed great home cooked food with a bit of banter thrown in from Tom, he even added some of his chips to the plate for us to try very nice.The Chicken & Leek pie I had was just fab great taste.Next time your in Greenwich you gotta stop by as next time I will order the Ham it looked lovely.Dont go if your in a rush no fast food here just great food.Hope to see you soon Tom big thanks."
"We saw this place had opened up locally so thought we'd give it a try. At first glance prices did't seem bad, not cheap but not too expensive. We went for Mezze/tapas options. When the food Arrived.. we were extremely impressed at how fresh and flavourful everything was. There seems to be real care over the ingredients used. From recollection we had the cold mousa'ka , houmos with lamb, vine leaves, meatballs/kibbeh, the spicy sausages and a few others. Little additions such as tahini/smoked aubergine and great olive oil with the dishes made a big difference. Base tempranillo was great too, plenty of spcie and tannins without overdoing it. Also had a nice international wine selection. Highly recommended!"
We went to TGI Fridays for our office Christmas lunch. The service was really slow and it took us over 3 hours to have our meal. We waited over 30 minutes for our dessert and watched a waiter serve and be attentive to every table around us but we were ignored. We were going to order more cocktails but gave up due to this. The only good thing was that a waitress recognised we'd waited too long for dessert and took the 2 bottles of wine we'd had off our bill!
"Service was good but we had pizza, salmon salad and steak. All tasteless and over price thanks Jamie Oliver"
"This, for me is THE British restaurant, BUT it's very male, clubish, with up market school days food. Whatever... I love the atmosphere and the food, and, well, you have to pay for really good stuff don't you."
"I am not from London, but was taken here by a friend who knows it well, and likes the more unusual venues.I thought it was great from start to finish.The food is in 'tapas' style, but I would describe it more as a lot of different starters to choose from, as the portions were fairly large.I am vegetarian and the waitress knew about all the ingredients, and which would be best for me. We had two each and shared one, which I found was a bit too much, but my friend ate everything he had. It was very unusual food - lots of exotic ingredients, but well chosen.We had a pudding, coffee and stuck to pale ale for the meal. It was a bit pricey, but not outlandish - and worth the money for the atmosphere, unusual food and great service."
"On my far to infrequent visits to London we always end up at this place, really nice atmosphere, nice beers and just generally really chilled, food seems good and it's great on a match day, if you're near Finsbury Park check it out......"
"I live near this establishment and have visited numerous times. I'm sorry to say, seems to be going down hill. Went a few weeks ago only to be told the ""kitchen is broken"". Went yesterday and was charged 24 pounds for two glasses of only fair quality Malbec. When I asked if I could buy the bottle instead for only 10 pounds more, the bartender said he couldn't figure out how to do that because he had been at work for 18 hours. When I first moved here, I enjoyed visiting this pub, so am sorry to say I won't be back m"
"Very busy, but had pre booked. Had lovely meal. Calamari starters were very substantial. Cod croquettes, and cheese/beetroot salad were very nice. Two of us had the special two course for £12:50. Mushroom crepes were very good. Chicken breast was lovely, and I had the Sea bream with warm cucumber and dill which was lovely. Photo attached. Took one mouthful, them remembered to take photo!"
I called in here with my wife and we were offered the last two available seats by the bar. We had been meaning to go here for some time as we have a home nearby but had never previously got around to it. We both thought the place was great - it has a really nice buzzy cosy atmosphere and all of the the food that we had was outstanding. We will definitely return soon.
"We took the kids here for lunch yesterday, before going to the theatre, so it was mainly kids pizzas ordered. They enjoyed them and cleaned the plate and really really enjoyed the homemade ice cream after. However I ordered the grilled salmon with the cucumber and red onion accompaniment. The salmon was a teeny bit overdone but perfectly edible. However I spent some time nibbling at the veg/ salad honestly trying to figure out how it could be so bland. I added a bit of salt and tried again. Ditto again. It felt like it had been made a long time before and so had lost the crunch and flavour but there was still a little crunch so that wasn't it. Disappointing. Husband had the spicy pizza and said it was really good and the American couple at the next table had a variety of tasters and said they enjoyed it all. Service was excellent and friendly and of course the atmosphere was great. I'd give it another try for sure."
"This is why most restaurants should be shut down, the food is okay - but seriously overpriced. You pay £9 for a scallop and yes their T bone is 2 square inches not to mention chicken undercooked. And yes, they have a number of servers with facial hair but it's seriously off putting to constantly see the hairy crack whilst being sat at the bar. The worse bit isn't that you have to wave to get their attention but the fact they dump your used cutlery on a table they barely sponge. Overall, I wonder what level of hygiene they work on. Please don't go - they are many others down the road that can be a lot more value for money - significantly more comfortable."
"A trip to London wouldn't be complete without a post theatre supper at The Wolseley. The food is always excellent and this time was no different. My particular favourite is Smoked Haddock Monte Carlo. The atmosphere is buzzy and noisy and the setting very special. It isn't particularly cheap (expect £10 and up for a standard glass of wine), but certainly worth it in my view."
"Visited Rules at 10.45 pm after a show round the corner and it was wonderful. Not surprisingly it was quite quiet for a late Monday night, which made it even morecharacterful (almost having a tavern or Inn feeling) ..... We were shown to a really nice corner snug and order the half chicken and Steak and Kidney Pudding with Oyster. The food was wonderful with surprisingly large portions. The chicken (especially the skin) was delightful with truffle butter and the Pudding was filled with huge chunks of meat. The only thing that did let it down was the accompaniments (saluted potatoes 'ho-hum' and the oyster so overpowered and lost in crumbs) ... they really did not match up to the quality of the mains. The staff were extremely friendly and chatty even at this late stage of service ..... and the bill was very small for the evening.Bottom line .... cannot wait to go again especially during the game season ... and really would want to look to book for the later slots."
I had walked past this place a few times but had never been drawn to try it until recently. Beyond the steaming preparation area at the front it's essentially a small corridor of a restaurant with a some shared tables (there appeared to be an upstairs as well which I didn't experience). I was a little startled by the initial welcome where we were abruptly told to get back by the door to wait when there wasn't either a queue or any indication to wait in an unmarked holding area. It seemed to go downhill from there (let's just say I don't like being bossed around by a waitress) until another member of staff noticed and asked if we wanted to be moved to the main area on a shared table. The atmosphere is better but be prepared to stand up to let your neighbour through if they need to visit the facilities. The soup is reasonably tasty but the portion a touch on the measly side for anything from £9 to £11 considering how cheap noodles are. Gyoza starters were pretty average.
"Breakfast is my favourite meal of the day and not something I like to mess around with.Saturday morning the Step was buzzing with young professionals blowing off the cobwebs with great coffee and bloody Mary's.The big breakfast is exactly what you need to get the weekend back on track. Great quality meat, scrambled eggs cooked perfectly, incredible sourdough toast and all served piping hot by happy smiley staff.....The lunch and dinner menu looked awesome but until I can justify two visits in a day, breakfast is the meal for me"
If you are going to the theatre or returning for a late night bite this is the place for you. Its worth booking and can be found easily on line. Its buzzing and the food is very good.
"Went to see The Beach Boys and decided to try the Heliot Steak House which is in the Hippodrome, Leicester Square (ish). I was expecting great things from the restaurant and was not disappointed! We were looked after by a young Italian lady called Camilla who was lovely in that she was extremely efficient and also particularly pleasant. My wife has scallops to start while I had the crab. Both were very nice. But I had come for the Steak! My better half had bass in a salt crust and I elected for the 23 oz T bone. As it was a treat I also had a lobster tail on top of the Steak, triple cooked chips and a bernaise sauce. My steak was cooked perfectly for me ( I had it medium). We both agreed that the meal was lovely. The whole evening was brilliant as you overlook the gaming arena which is below. The whole evening was great. We went to the bar after for a couple of drinks. The bar seems very pricey (£20 for two glasses of wine) but then again you have to consider where you are, so probably to be expected. Overall the evening will remain a very pleasant memory for us both. Brilliant and will visit again. Give it a try if you are that way for a treat. ( The food actually is not too pricey, it's the drinks that perhaps are the Killer!). Still had a great time though."
"We only went here because someone had bough us a ""voucher"" thing for it.This would NOT have been anywhere I'd have visited !!!Decor is a little bit like an old church hall or village hall that's been (badly) converted into a restaurant.Just ""brown"" and drab & dreary !!!They didn't fully redeem our voucher so we still had to add extra cash, but that's OK I guess ............Service was (over) attentive .... again .... that's OKFood was really good (steak cooked to perfection)It just felt like a ""tourist"" place lacking any real distinctive voice, character or flavour of its own.Average"
"Wagama's has long been a favorite of mine for good clean Asian food, with a beer or two added in so that it is not too healthy. The Seafood ramen is described as a soup but ifs huge and has loads of seafood in it, excellent value. Other favorites are the Katsi Curry and a side of Duck Goyza. The staff are relaxed and if you want to have a quick eat and go they will help with that but are also happy for a group of you to sit eat and chat."
"After working late we didn't feel like cooking at home so Tootoomoo in Crouch End was the venue. Exciting decor and lively and helpful staff and a great environment built up the appetite. We loved the Soft Shell Crab Tempura and Crispy Smoked Chicken (could have eaten the starters all evening!).The range of large dishes, Sushi, Sashimi and Salads got us hooked on this great Pan Asian eatery after having Beef Rendang (coconut & sweet potatoes) and Duck and Watermelon Salad. The aromas coming out of the open kitchen area just simply make you hungry! The wine on offer os not too expensive with a more than average Malbec for £11.95. Also discovered they do a take-away service.Whether you're tired and hungry and just want a lively night out with exciting easy-to-eat food, Tootoomoo seems to have the answer."
"Being now in my 20s I'm verging into the realm of doing slightly more sophisticated things to enjoy the weekend rather than just raving. Bank holiday Friday evening I met my boyfriend from work in Farringdon and we headed via recommendation to Polpo for dinner. It could be easily walked past if not aware of its existence but as soon as you walk through the doors and you're struck with cosy atmosphere. Although we were walk-ins on a Friday night we were able to sit straight at the bar. We could have waited for a table but as it were just the two of us the bar suited us perfectly. Plus it meant we could watch the bartenders concoct the cocktails in front of us. The menu has something for everyone. Meat, Fish, Vegetarian and Sweet. It's best to treat it with a tapas approach to share as some dishes are larger than others. Personally would recommend the pizzette and bruschetta. The cocktails are small but packed with alcohol. It's rather expensive as expected from London but as a treat it was totally worth it (at least I hope he thinks so as he paid!)"
"I'm not an expert in asian food, but I have highly appreciated this restaurant. Staff was very fliendly and helpful, service perfect, and food fine and tasty. Spices (and not only hot) are balanced with flavours and are not an excuse to give food a general exotic mood. Last but not least, good value for money. Enjoy."
"AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!!!! The service was perfect, the food was prefect... so pleased we went. We had the Chateaubriand for two.. it was the best steak i ever had!!!"
"I booked a table for my Husband myself and my in laws at this restaurant on the 8th February for a meal on Saturday 21st February, received a confirmation email so thought all good.Only to have the manager call me four days before to say he was cancelling my booking due to a problem with their online booking system, what a load of rubbish he is going to make much more money as he has a special Wham bam evening there. What terrible customer service I am certain he must have been fully aware he had a cabaret night on that date a lot earlier than 4 days before. Not impressed at all not easy finding an alternative this late and I shouldn't have been made too !!!"
Fantastic food and wonderful service. The avocado and crab appetizer (AVOCAT au CRABE) was a terrific blend of flavors. Definitely worth the try.
We ate at this restaurant & thought the staff were absolutely great especially the young girl who was our waitress her name was Charlotte. She was so nice & friendly. Unfortunately we would not eat here again :( our meals were not great my meal was overcooked & cold. & our starters were awful :(
"Visited here on Sat 5th Dec for breakfastHad a window table so a great view of the dockThe staff are lovely , friendly and efficientThen it goes down hillBaked beans come in there own little pan ....a nice touch, the pan was cold as were the beans.The fried eggs seemed to have been cooked beforehand and kept until needed......they were tepidThe bacon appeared to be streaky, was soggy ........and coldSausages , mushrooms were fineWe have had far better breakfasts in other nearby establishmentsA full English Breakfast was £14.50 ..........not good value for the standard of the food"
"I dined here on Saturday 31st January and had the £25 set menu with glass of Prosecco deal. The service was faultless and each dish that my friend and I had was excellent including the main (pork belly) which was served piping hot. The Prosecco was an excellent one (not cheap and nasty as sometimes happens with these inclusive deals) and so we ordered a bottle to have throughout the meal. It's always lovely to dine by the Thames, but quite special to be on the river looking across at the London Eye and Southbank. Would highly recommend this restaurant."
"Nice venue, well decorated, good range of well prepared food, although more salad options would be good. It was busy which is a good sign and we will definitely go back."
"We enjoyed our dinner here. The place overlooks the park, but not such a big deal in the dark. The staff was nice and we enjoyed all of our 3 courses. My crayfish and corn risotto appetizer was superb and my wife loved her lamb main course. We will eat dinner here next time we are in London."
Excellent welcome and ambiance. Good menu with attentive service.I would recommend the chateaubriandWorth seeking this restaurant out from the rest.
"We expected more from this restaurant. I felt that the warm welcome was somewhat reduced when we mentioned we were dining on an offer. I ordered the ""Hix Mix"" cocktail and my husband a beer. I had nearly finished my drink before my husband received his despite being told by 3 members of staff it was on its way when queried. (We were seated approx 9 feet from the bar).The ""amuse bouche"" of falafel and goats cheese was so spicy we couldnt eat it. I felt my main course of fish was cooked in the microwave. It was OK but nothing special .Pleasant surroundings but food and service not up to the mark."
We ordered SEVERAL dishes at lunch today & were informed that they had no Chinese broccoli or pea aubergines or holy basil or baby corn or lemon grass or ............the list goes on. The food tasted as though it was cooked using sauces that came out of a bottle and lots of onions as the main vegetable. The complete lack of fresh herbs and thai/asian vegetables made the food taste very basic & certainly not worth the money we paid for it! The quality of the chicken & the prawns was very average at best. Very disappointing indeed!
"Both of us are chefs and having a night off from work, so it was lovely to try a 5 course tasting menu some fizz and a bottle of AlbariÌ±o and finish off meeting the chef and visiting the spotlessly clean kitchen! The service was second to none and the tasting menu was fantastic flavours and wonderful theatre to match, my favourite dish was egg in leaf such intense flavours and closely followed by lamb with lotus with a kiwi sauce which just melted in your mouth! Wonderful night off and will come back to try more!"
"Went out of our way to come here for Sunday lunch last weekend.The bar area was full, so even though we'd made a reservation, we had to take a table in the basement.Food was just okay, but nothing special in my view. Service was okay. Disappointed, as I was looking forward to some really nice tapas having read the reviews on TA.The food all came at the same time which was also disappointing, so the meal did not feel very leisurely.At least it was quite cheap."
"For outstanding burgers you cannot do better that Byron, and we have found this particularly so at Byron Rathbone Place. Delicious meal, excellent service from friendly staff, and good ambience."
This place is a 24 hour diner with a fancy twist. It sits up high with a fantastic view. The food was tasty and we enjoyed the cocktails as well.
Went here for a business lunch and loved every minute of it. Their menu outlines everything which is gluten free (which was most things) so I tucked into the grilled aubergines followed by some pho and finished off with some coconut ice cream with coffee. Highly recommend and will be back!!!
An outstanding dining experience at the Park Terrace Restaurant. Fantastic service from the whole team. The food was outstanding and the best I have eaten in my life. The crayfish and sweetcorn risotto starter was to die for. The steak main course were excellent. The steak just melted in my mouth. Highly recommended.
Would highly recommend this public house for a good beer in clean comfortable surrounding. Then onto a good Thai meal at a very reasonable price for the location.Will return and would have no hesitation in recommending to friends.
"Came here on Thursday before Easter for lunch and cocktails. Lovely food, great cocktails, nice layout etc. but the main purpose of this was to commemorate our waiter Adam who was very helpful, really friendly and supplied an overall fantastic service. There was bar training going on at the same so some of the drinks took a little while to come, but Adam explained the situation and it was no problem at all. His shift finished before we could leave him a suitable tip so hoped this would suffice instead."
"2nd time going to this place and I might say i love it. If you go on Mondays you can get great deals on food and wines. All the staff is very helpful, I can't remember the manager name but i love him, he is very funny and great customer service. Also, the waiter Daniel, who took care of me and my friend was great. Smiley and polite with good sense of humor, they really made my evening more pleasant. About food, love it. I had squid and the ribs and they are very tasty and great value. Highly recommended! keep it up the great stuff!"
"Fantastic meal, and ale. This restaurant is up to the finest standards of great international dining experiences. Every appetizer, salad, main course, and dessert was special. In particular, try the rib roast for two or the filet mignon - both exceptional."
"I brought my wife here for afternoon tea as part of her birthday celebrations. A few days prior, a member of the staff contacted me to check on dietry requirements, and offered a complimentary service to acknowledge the occasion - I thought it was a very nice offer. Upon arriveal, we were greeted very politely and our coats were stored safely and securely. We had a nice view of the park, and the staff waiting on us were very polite, very nice, and very helpful. I should like to thank them for putting a candle on the chocolate cake, and also thank the gentleman for singing happy birthday to my wife! The food was wonderful, and the selection of teas plentiful. We were made to feel like we could stay as long as we liked, and we were not interrupted except for offers of more food and more tea. Thank you all at the Park Terrace Restaurant, it was a wonderful experience - one I would love to repeat again in the future."
"The food at Rules is good, and the portions are quite large. The service is outstanding! Take time to looks at the walls in the restaurant as it's a fun history lesson by itself."
"We have been coming to this restaurant very occasionally, on and off for many years. It has never in our view been brilliant but it always had something about it that drew us back. This evening I think marked a turning point. Of the entire restaurant there were only five tables occupied, two of then with single occupants, one couple, the other a party of five that left shortly after we Arrived. The service was good without being excellent but the food was truly awful. Cold, over cooked, burnt or insipid. Of the five of us, one dish - chicken with mashed potato - passed muster, otherwise none of us could finish our meal. We did make our feelings known to our waitress; she sniffly said she would tell the chef. Perhaps she did but there was no evidence of it. Sadly I don't think we will ever go back."
"Poor service, very oily fish, not using the matzo coating, small portion of chips now, it's all about how much profit!What a shame!Go to the Nautilus , Fortune Green Road!"
Spend a couple of hours sitting on the deck in the sun with friends having drinks and some food. Its a pity no table service. The food was nice but very little choice. Nice place to send a couple of hours and just watching the sights of London.
Nice pub with good food and a decent selection of beers. In the summer it is nice to sit outside on the terrace.
"ive been here for a dinner with some friends. really nice place, really nice view and awesome food and wine. Our waitress Jiulia were really nice and helpful with her knowledge. Perfect!"
Having walked past this pub may times and never gone in preferring other pubs in the area we thought we'd give it a go. The lady behind the bar was covered in tattoos and had multi coloured hair none of these were a problem that was her FILTHY finger nails! They had dirty under them. Not good when serving drinks and food! She also seemed much more interested in rolling her roll up then serving myself and my partner. During serving us she carried on her conversation with another staff member about a series she was watching. all in all the service was terrible and with the amount of decent pubs in the area i will swerve The Kings Head next time! only thing i would say was the burger i had was delicious Shame bout the staff member though i will be watching the box set she was banging on about sounded fascinating!
"Visited with friend for an impromptu dinner. Found the room slightly gloomy but liked the beer selection. 'shabby chic interior, just about gets away with it. Water is served in tin jugs, our had a rusty bottom so felt compelled to order a bottle. Homemade bread at a price proved hard but had good flavour. Scallops were good, Chicken popcorn average, pate was good. For mains, the general feeling was the cow pie, with the melting marrowbone was the star dish. Unctuous and meaty with a good proper crust. The Kiev slightly disappointed as it looked so good and delivered less. I am sure most people would have found this to be a good dish..and it looked like they were selling well, but on a point of culinary taste, it felt like it needed more garlic, more flavour, more taste. Steaks were served at the right level of cooking, but a med rare steak was still cold and the rare steak was a little colder than that.Service was ok, if a little disinterested and I felt no warmth from the service staff, as I am sure they felt no feelings about me..dessert made an appearance and were enjoyed, which at least left a warm ending. Around £40 per head with some wine."
"With the feel on unity in the air after the recent Scottish referendum we felt the need for a good British Meal, and after experiencing some great food in other Jamie Oliver restaurants, it was decided to go to Union Jacks. Lets just say we will not be returning.We went on a Saturday night and this place (being in Covent Garden) was very busy. Joining the line we didn't have to wait long and we were seated. The wait staff were all very nice and we had no problem. Occasionally they forgot about bringing tap water to the table but obviously this isn't put into the computer so can easily be forgotten when busy.The issue we had was with the food. We ordered the Garlic Mushroom dish to start and it can only be described as a oily, crumbly mess and the garlic taste was wildly overpowering (benefits of this is my immunity to vampires now). For the main I had a pizza (not very British) but my company had the lamb of which was overcooked and bland in taste. The vegetable's were overpowering with mustard. As for the pizza there was not much to the taste of it and I was not happy with the quality of the meal. We decided to skip desert on this instance due to the quality of the first 2 servings.I don't think that this place created a good atmosphere but honestly, where it is located it would be difficult to do so. The music raises the level of the crowd inside that it can get quite loud inside. The tables are extremely close and you feel packed in and the leg room on the seating is tight if you are tall.Overall I wont be returning. There are other Jamie Oliver Restaurants that are better in the quality of the food as well as the overall dining experience."
today i thought ill treat my mum for easter so decided as we have been many times and always been good but today i must say i was less than impressed i was ordering at the bar and i had a trainnie bar man serving which im fine with as we all need to learn unfortunatly he was not being shaddowed and was really struggling but remained patiaint through out as like i said we have to all learn. but he didnt really have a clue what he was doing i had to ask for a clean glass as the one used for my wine was clearly dirty but what shoocked me most was the lad was gonna poor the wine from dirty glass to a clean glass and had to ask him not to and to poor a new one then come the price of the food as we had been there before and always order the same i found this time was a little more expensive but out that down to trainnie not doing something right but left it as wasnt much. when our oder come out it was completely wrong now the young man that brought our food what very polite and helpful and got a slim chap in a blue shirt to come and see to us this is when things started to get really bad firstly being told this is what we ordered so after explaining this was not our mistake was the young trainnie he took the reciept and then come back stating that our order was now going to cost us even more money now im sitting in shock as like i stated i have ordered the same thing over and over and its never cost this much but worst of all we had to ask for an appology and the reply we had was well im trying to help you and we are busy which did make me laugh for the first time every i have managed to get a table and even have a choice of tables that how busy it was even when our new order had come it was wrong now i dont blame the trainnie as i think if he had someone with him he would have been fine i dont blame the young man bringing our food he was kind polite and very helpful it seemed there was 2 people who could have sorted this properly the chap in the blue shirt or even a rather tall slim lady who may have been a manager but this i have to question as we asked for the manager and was told he would be in the folloing day
"Good food, good service, a decent bottle of wine all at a reasonable price. We had a really lovely lunch here."
We called in at this pub as we were staying at the Travelodge across the way.The pub wasn't too busy when we went in which didn't bother us at all - think we got in before the theatre rush.The menu isn't extensive but whats on there is more than enough to feed a hungry tourist or somebody wanting a pre-theatre meal.I had the Halloumi cheese and Portobello mushroom ciabatta whilst my husband went for the pie and mash (with gravy not liquor). Both were freshly made and delicious.Service was great from the moment we walked through the door to exiting. This pub doesn't have the feel of an inner city pub as you're made to feel like a 'local' even though you're only there for a short time.Definitely would recommend.
I know this is a big call to make especially in London.. but THE BEST SUNDAY ROAST!! I applause you chef for making a rainy Sunday so much better. Thank you !! Highly Recommend
"Heard about this place through instagram and was not disappointed. It was the first time ive had lobster and as an absolute burger fan, the food met the expectations. Amazing service, the waitress showed me how to eat the lobster and was very helpful charging my boyfriend's phone while we were eating. Will definitely come back, 100% for the lobster."
had a late night meal with a friend of mine tonight. got there after 9 pm and they were very happy to serve us. the ribs were to die for and so was the garlic seafood. fried rice melted in you're mouth. nice decor and great friendly service from the thai staff. dinner for 2 with a beer all for 30 pounds was excellent value. definitely be back again next time i am in london
"The food was good, but we were rushed to finish our starters. Mentioned it to the wiring staff who said that the chefs were in a hurry."
"Good friendly staff, good atmosphere, we were there on a Friday, busy, go early or book. Food very good, staff attentive , wish we had gone back there on the Saturday rather than cafe rouge"
"Date night with my hubby and it was just a lovely experience. The seater made us feel very welcomed which set the tone and atmosphere for the evening. The decor was lovely. Our waitress was very attentive, didn't have to wait long for our dinner which I enjoyed thoroughly. I wasn't a fan of French cuisine till now..I will be returning. Who knew Blackheath was so alive... : D"
"ive waited a long time to have a good pub restaurant close to where I live and at last it has Arrived. The old White Hart was an all right local boozer where you could go with your mates, have a few beers and that was about it and there was nothing wrong with that. The new White Hart is a good local boozer where you can go with your mates and have a few beers, or go out for a meal or both. The food is very good although my vegetarian wife would like a bit more choice. The staff have been brilliant, both fun and helpful and however busy they are always seem to be available. The food is pitched at the gastro pub market; ive had venison, Sunday lunches and tuna with curried spinach all being very good and reasonably priced. To me this is the ideal local pub."
"If you are looking for a more upmarket traditional pie & beer place, this place are made for you. Pie tasted very good and beers were very closed to British ale. The food quality was above the rest of the local pubs and sizes were good too!The decor was elegant but kept in a traditional design.I will recommend all oversea tourists to try this place!Personally I think that prices are not that expensive."
"ive been to engawa for several times, and i think this place is good if you love wagyu beef. The service is good as well. I tried omakase, which consists of appetiser, combination of sashimi and vegetables, wagyu steak, rice, and miso soup. I tried both wagyu beef and kobe beef, and kobe beef you need to pay extra money for the omakase. Overall, the sashimi is good, and the wagyu and kobe beef are really delicious, I'll come back again."
"Fancied a top drink in a top bar as soon as we got off train at kings cross and the German gymnasium didn't disappoint. We went up to the meister bar, had the German gin and tonic and the Londons garden. Garnished perfect, served with a smile in a fantastic building. Could have sat there for hours. Lovely place"
"This hotel is worth seeing, regardless of whether you become a patron. It is located on Kensington Church Street - roughly midway between Kensington High Street and Notting Hill. Apart from the interior artefacts linked to Churchill, the exterior is covered with botanical displays, like no other place we have seen anywhere. This time, in December, it was 185 Christmas trees. A suggestion would be to catch the Tube to either Notting Hill Gate or Kensington High Street station, and then walk to the other via Kensington Church Street, past the Churchill Arms. There are many interesting shops and other places in the area"
"My wife's special B-day and our dining experience at Gaucho was top-notch. The hostess took our coats and poured us each a warm Argentinian Christmas drink ananÌÁ fizz.. delish. We made our way downstairs to the dining room. modern atmosphere, with cow-fur decor mixed throughout the room. Our sever, Ebony, was outstanding and she and the rest of the staff made the occasion all the more delightful. The cuts of meat were presented in pre-cooked form and we went with the marinated fillet ...outstanding.We had the pumpkin salad, 3-types of bread served with olive oil, butter or a chimichurri spread, Our steak was cooked perfectly and melted in your mouth, it was served ala-carte with mashed potatoes and green beans.. my mouth is watering while I write this. We rounded out dinner with a perfect Argentinian Malbac , Ebony's recommendation. Our celebration was topped-off with a warm apple crisp & vanilla ice cream, Ebony brought some more ice cream because we hadn't finished the apple crisp but had polished-off the ice cream. B-Day mini truffles were also presented to melt in ones mouth.... Ole' Gaucho... Thank you for a perfect B-Day evening. Larry & Eva"
"We ate here twice during our time in London. Both times the service was good, the meals were prompt, and tasty.Not the cheapest of meals, and the size of the meals don't reflect the price, but overall the meals are good, and you know you are going to get consistent quality."
"You serve yourself, bring over your own food and pay over the odds for the food. The staff just seem to want to get you in and to the till to take your money, This is one for the tourist,come to London to be ripped off, who don't mind paying the extra money for nothing or bankers!"
"We celebrated my girlfriend's dinner there and the food was good but I agree with some other reviewers it's a little overpriced for what it is.We had the Dorset crab & burrata as starters. For mains we chose the Halibut & the beef. All dishes were good, especially the crab & the beef but nothing especial to it for the price you pay. Service was slow and overall atmosphere felt a bit cold."
"What a great find. Really nice food; attentive staff and a nice selection of wines (that won't break the bank). Went with three friends last weekend and we all said that we'd like to go back.We each had a starter and a main, plus naan bread. None of us had a pudding but we had four bottles of wine between us (so a bottle each). Our total was £40 per head which I thought was really very good, given how nice the food had been."
"Been to TGI Fridays plenty of times so knew what to expect from the food however this particular experience was terrible, we waited an hour for 5 out of the 6 meals ordered to arrive, the 6th person in our party had to wait a further 15 mins for her food, when it Arrived it was the wrong order so she then had to wait again, after we had eaten coffee's were ordered, all ok, except for one which was like a cup of syrup! The coffee was replaced but we had to wait again for milk, asked for cream for the coffee and was given a small pot of whipped cream! The waiter was very apologetic and we could tell he was embarrassed, the bill came to over £150 and for the quality of the food and the mistakes made with our meal it definitely did not seem worth it, will not be in a rush to return"
"My boyfriend and I came in and were seated right near the door (it was around 6:00pm so the restaurant was half empty). The double doors were wide open and it was quite cold so my boyfriend politely asked the door staff if we could move two tables up... She was very rude and told us we couldn't, however 3 mins later when another couple came in she sat them there... Tables were sticky and my menu was stuck together I almost ripped it when opening it!! PLEASE WIPE THEM DOWN!Our waiter was nice and got the doors closed for us (don't know why the girl on the door didn't do that for us in the first place!). 20 minutes after ordering somebody came over and asked if we could move tables as they needed to push ours together with the one next to it to accommodate a group of 6 and if we could go sit near the window- not great service however they did offer to cancel charge of the cocktails off our bill which I decided was fair so agreed. After waiting quite a while our mains Arrived... Before our starters! So they were sent back, there had been a mix up apparently and our starters had been sitting on the side. Apparently they recooked fresh ones for us but who knows! Food was very good though - just overall a weird experience. Similar prices to hard rock but this restraint doesn't even compare to the service and cleanliness- will be choosing hard rock next time for sure."
"I ended up on the Hispaniola for a friends party last Saturday evening. I suffer from sea sickness horribly. The staff at the entrance were so helpful, giveing me sea sickness bands and making sure I was okay.However the nicest part was the bar staff, in particular one lovely lovely french guy called Anis... he was attentive, polite and extremely professional throughout the whole evening. He made the experience for myself and our group an absolute pleasure. I'll definitely be recommending it to friends and I'll definitely be back."
"ive always loved the Charterhouse Bar, I work nearby so it's alway's been great for a cheeky lunchtime pint in the heart of super cool Farringdon but it's so much more than that.Great service, great food and always lot's of fun, ive been to so many cool parties and we always end up back at the Charterhouse at the end of the evening. Lovely staff, great cocktails, fantastic venue."
"Met here for brunch before flying abroad and immediately the staff were very helpful with storing my suitcases whilst we ate. The food was nice and reasonably priced, although my breakfast of a yoghurt and fruit was slightly small and disappointing. The staff were very friendly and helpful, and were happy with us staying for hours - there was no rushed feeling like you get in some places as soon as you've finished eating. I'd definitely recommend Cote."
"The Old Dairy was a great restaurant, one of my favorite in North London.But ive been there today for a lunch, it was a nightmare !!!1 - The Menu was quite exactly the same as the last time ive been there few month ago. 2 - When the food came on the table what a shame !!! There was rottenness on a fig & the ham was in very bad condition. The smell was also terrible.3 - I have told about this problem to the girl at the bar, she has promised to advert the chief but she didn't really make apologizes and she has not propose to change the dish for a new one.During the afternoon, ive been sick with terrible stomach ache.The Old Dairy is still a lovely place to have a drink but not a good & safest place to eat anymore, the chief is certainly not the same one, I can't recommend anybody this place."
"ive been to this restaurant for the first time and I loved it, the atmosphere was amazing, the food was perfect and our waiter Simone made our evening with his excellent service and his recommendation on food and wine. Thanks to him ive discovered a new dessert, can't wait to go there again!"
"Just had a horrendous experience at TGI's in Covent Garden which will ensure I never darken its doors again. Food took 45+ minutes to come, and when it did it was almost entirely inedible, with the bread in the burgers and hotdogs stale to the point that it disintegrated on contact with the mouth (either that or it had been nuked while waiting under the heat lamps at the pass), and everything else straight from the freezer. Chips, which aren't hard to do, were also foul. The drinks were refunded off the bill without having to ask, which was something, but in no way made up for an appalling experience."
we were told that we couldnt have sandwiches and cakes and tea.....but were told to look at the menu. We left.
"We've been to Gaucho, Four Seasons, Mango Tree et al. The Park Terrace has very good food, great service and and very good setting. Overall our best experience in London this time."
Visited for my 30th birthday. Lucky enough to get a window seat upstairs so had a great view of tower bridge. Very friendly and professional staff. Steak was cooked perfectly and so tender. Would recommend the scallop starter.
"Jamie never disappoints! One of the best pizzas ive ever had, and the ambience was splendid. The service was also awesome!"
"We are from Philadelpia, PA, USA. We have eaten in Persian restaurants in CA, PA and Washington DC, this restaurant is as good as some of the best in the USA. The ghameh is as good as our Iranian grandmother's recipe. The mastkair and fresh nan are exceptional. We would highly recommend to any of our family and friends."
"We had excellent food, though it was at least an hour between courses, despite nudging. When the bill Arrived they had added random items and when we contested them we were laughed at. Possibly the worst service ive ever experienced."
"If I could eat here everyday, I would!Elliot's is more than just a cafe, it's an experience. What I love about this place, is that they make extremely tasty meals from almost every part of an animal, very little waste. My favourite has to be the chicken hearts on skewers and sweet breads followed by everything else on the menu.There's always something new on their menu and it's quite often seasonal.If you don't believe me, http://www.elliotscafe.com/ check them out & book a table before you arrive!"
"It's informal, it's rustic and full of flavours. We visited with group of friends and we had fantastic time. Best to prepare yourself what are you in for to avoid disappointment. Dishes are varied and simply presented, food is incredibly fresh and with interesting twist to it. There are some basic flavours and dishes too - like meatballs. I think everyone is able to find something for themselves there. Collection of small plates arrives as they come ready in the kitchen - so you just need to relax and enjoy the experience. Love the place."
"After visiting the National Gallery we walked around and found Thai Square. Great find! The food (basically Thai and Chinese-Asian fusion) was delicious -as well as the service -and the airy & large pretty space. We ordered 2 ""boxes"" from a lunch special menu with chicken & cashew nuts as the main dish -and to start we shared a generous size appetizer -and everything was great!! A beer and mineral water -and the bill was $47.00 inc tip. Wonderful! I now have a new favorite in the Trafalgar Square area and do not have to go to nearby Pret-a-Manger all the time. Recommended!"
"Four of us went for dinner to celebrate a birthday. Got an offer via a website otherwise wouldn't have really considered this restaurant. So glad we did.Firstly the atmosphere is just right, not too stuffy. The staff were all really pleasant and the overall service was efficient but not obtrusive. We had a cocktail beforehand in the bar which was also very good.The food was excellent, and as the four of us all had something different on each course it is great to say that everyone thought the same. All in all thoroughly recommend, and good value as well."
"A group of us had the tasting menu, great value, fantastic flavours and plenty to eat. The deserts to finish were something else fabulously presented and delicious. Well worth a visit."
"The restaurant itself is pleasant enough and the staff are friendly, if a little bored looking.The food is overpriced and of a poor standard in my opinion. Given the choice I would go to Preto next door, which is much better value for money and better quality food too. Like another reviewer, I found myself looking at Nando's over the road thinking I could have done better going there (and I am no fan of Nando's either).I cannot recommend Dim T and there are many other restaurant's in the area to choose from."
The restaurant located inside John Lewis and noticed that it is a chain restaurant. The food was reasonable price and good in size and taste.
"Fabulous small plates, great for sharing, and fabulous food. Not always obvious translations but the waiter service in here is great, knowledgeable, offer alternative (better) plates and really seem to enjoy working here. Some of the best dishes were Spicy ÷nduja & ricotta crostini (nice little kick), Goat cheese, roasted grape & walnut bruschetta (really tasty), Baked cauliflower & Fontina (really lovely - we were fighting over this one!). Good wine list and negroni bar downstairs (but does sometime have priveate functions). Excellent meal, jovial atmosphere and I will definitely be back again very soon."
"In London? Looking for food quick? Love Japanese food? If yes, then this is the place for you! Don't worry it's not all fish, there are chicken and vegetarian options to. If you've not had it before then try the mango aloe vera juice."
"An evening meal ruined by the service. We asked specifically for our garlic bread pizza to be given to us at the same time as the mains. Garlic bread turned up early and went cold whilst we waited for the mains. I asked for a replacement, which they said they would deliver but then the pizza turned up before the garlic bread, luckily only around 3 minutes later.Food was OK, but the service let it down and ruined the experience."
"Rude inattentive staff, average food, expensive prices.After arriveing there was no one to take our coats, then we were left at our table with no waiter arriveing for twenty minutes.We were ignored after asking for service TWICE.The food eventually Arrived luke warm.The waiters were charmless and we would have complained but it was meant to be a birthday celebration so we didn't want to complain.The bill was extremely expensive considering the service we received.A LONDON TOURIST TRAP.We will never return."
"We stumbled upon Cote one evening and were pleasantly surprised by the great quality and incredibly reasonable prices. The prix fixe menu is a great value and a welcome relief from the high prices typical of London restaurants. The service was attentive and accommodating, the atmosphere warm and inviting. It's very kid-friendly, though also a perfect spot for couples and groups of friends."
"Went here for food, sat waiting for 10 mins for someone to come up to us only to be told the tills were down so couldn't take our order"
"In between trains, this is a great option for a quick snack. Reasonably priced for London, very tasty food, some freshly made options while you wait. Mediterranean style, lots of Humus and Falafels etc. Quick and easy and a great change for Fast Foods."
Good for a quick drink before Jools Holland at the Royal Albert Hall - nice place to see and enjoy the atmosphere but not somewhere to spend the evening.
"Took my dad (and mum) here for Father's Day, we had a 4.30pm reservation but were allowed to seat early as the place was only about a third full anyway (was a Saturday afternoon).Having read the menu in advance I was really looking forward to it, especially having had afternoon tea only once before. We all chose the traditional menu with pear bellini. The tea selection was very good and the ones we chose very pleasant. The fancies were delicious and the scones some of the best ive ever eaten. Service was excellent as you'd expect from a high-end establishment.However the experience was soured by the non-replenishment of food items. Each person got 4 finger slices of sandwich (about the same in quantity terms as you'd get from half a packet sandwich) which, being afternoon tea sandwiches, came with a bare slither of filling. The minimal filling isn't an issue when (as with the only other afternoon tea I had) the sandwiches are replenished however at Reform Social & Grill they are not. So that's all you get. For £32.50!! To buy another 4 fingers cost £6.Thankfully we were able to derive some element of value due to the ÷free flowing champagne' deal however 5 glasses wasn't enough to wash away the bitter taste of feeling ripped off by the main event.Disappointed and won't return or recommend."
"The food was great, the staff and service was great. The restaurant was empty on a Friday night though. Why?!!!"
The portions are both very generous and reasonably priced. The burgers are excellent and the pizza fries I had were delicious. I think I'll be going back here a lot! Plus they deliver.
"Sketch was an experience. The decor is unique, quirky and a real talking point. All the rooms have a different theme and the toilets are bizarre. The service was first class. All the staff were really attentive and welcoming. We started with cocktails in the bar off the Gallery restaurant, laid out like the interior of a small spaceship.Food in the Gallery was a bit mixed. The starters were very good. We had twice cooked haddock souffle and the charcuterie with a mustard ice cream. The mains of confit cod and Iberico pork were not to our taste but perhaps we chose the wrong dishes. The dessert of omelette norvegienne was delicious.The wine we ordered was excellent if a bit pricey.Sketch is definitely worth a visit for the experience!"
"A family party of 11, we popped in for an early dinner following an afternoon on the Thames. We were amongst the only diners at the time, despite this service was slow and communication seemed poor between staff. We had 2 young children with us and when ordering their meals I asked the waitress if they could substitute the chips with a meal for some pasta, she said she would need to ask the manager and disappeared for 10 minutes. She returned, said it was fine and then handed us over to another waiter to complete the order. Despite this, the child's meal came without any sides at all and he eventually ended up with chips anyway. The food was poorly presented, garlic bread was dry and didn't appear to have any garlic. We asked for some jugs of water, they were warm and the water was dirty- as were several glasses. Any simple requests I.e cutlery, seemed to be complicated and take a lot of time. When I asked for the bill, the waitress tutted and raised her eyes! The place could do with a good clean too. Overall we left feeling unwelcome."
"Every year we always finish our touring days in here when we are on holiday.Just across the road from the Travel Lodge in Covent Garden it is such a friendly cosy pub,lovely staff and the food and the beer is great."
Went here last night with friends and the decor and food was terrible. The chicken was a lurid red colour and the lamb looked 'wrong' so I didn't dare try it. The daal was a solid block and very bland. I am surprised by the reviews as I regularly eat Indian food and this compares to the cheapest of bad takeaways rather than a great in-town restaurant.
"My first experience at Polpo (Chelsea - Duke of York Square) can only be described as a absolute disaster. The unfriendly lady with her clip board made us feel grateful that we can 'have' a table inside. I ordered 2 of the five tapas style fish dishes (Fritto misto, Salmon tartare) only to be told 20min later that they are no longer available. At this time my very unhappy salt cod crocchette Arrived. They were very dry and I asked the waiter if he could recommend something to go with them ''Ketchup?' he asked. Uhm, no thanks, I settled for Tobasco (a sin!) Our tapas Arrived one hour later with the waiter forgetting to bring my second dish, needless to say my little pizette the size of a small side plate left me feeling very very unhappy and still hungry. I watched as my guest struggled to cut her way through her ""Escaped birds"" skewer and a very bland looking plate of Mackerel. I can appreciate 'growing pains' with a newly opened restaurant (3 weeks I think) what i can't appreciate is mediocre food prepared without any appreciation of the ingredients which lies at the centre of Italian cooking. I wonder if my guest will feel like cooking any of the recipes of the Polpo cookbook which I regretfully thought would be a good idea to give to her before the evening? Guess not."
"Went to this place for a live jazz night. Overall this wasn't bad and the place nice and intimate. About the jazz, I'm not a real exist, but frankly I was expecting more a traditional one and not only swing.As part of the deal, we've been a shared platter, but this was a bit stingy on stuff. However the free drink and the 2 4 1 on drinks before eight compensated."
"TGI'S are usually a safe bet but this place was really very poor. When I enquired about a table for two the member of staff said she would come back to me but she did'nt. I eventually found someone else who was sufficiently interested to find us a table within view of the bar. The restaurant was busy but not manic and the atmosphere was very pleasant. Unfortunately that was the only positive thing that I can say about our visit as the food was pretty poor. My son and I both ordered 'monster burgers' which suggesteda large and succulent portion of meat which actually turned out to be two smaller burgers. This would have been perfectly fine if they had been nice to eat but the burgers had been cooked to death. They were tastleless,dry, and dense as if they had been heated twice or left to shrivel and harden. A truly pathetic offering for around £13 each. It was'nt possible to get a pint of beer as the row of beer taps at the bar were covered by a cloth suggesting that they were out of commission and when I asked for bottled beer shown on the menu card I was told that it was not availabel. Pathetic for such a large restaurant that attracts a high proportion of tourists. I could have complained of course, but this would have embarassed my 21 year old son who just wanted to cut our losses and leave. I gave our server £40 to cover the £34 and something bill. He must had awarded himself the change as his tip as that was the last I saw of him. The management of this branch of TGI's are falling down badly and even if it is a typical Tourist trap it should not be as bad as I have described. Eat somewhere else."
Tastes just like Italy!! Amazing food the pizza and pasta is amazing and totally worth going to. I do rather the pizza to the pasta but that us just me so enjoy!!!!
"This restaurant is local to me and I used to frequent a previous incarnation regularly. Visited on a Saturday night for a celebration and was bit disappointed. Menu was limited and expensive, no surprise in Dalston these days. Ordered just main courses, the cod dish, the bread, which I assume should arrive first, came with the main course, which was rather small, so we had to order chips too after it Arrived. Service was nice enough, and house wine was ok, but for the price, the food was not quite up to standard. Not rushing back."
"Had lunch here today and the food is wonderful. Being a traditionalist I ordered the cod and chips, and it was one of the best pieces of cod I have ever eaten. Crispy batter, perfect chips and the side order of mushy peas was delicious.Now complaints from my dining companions who both ordered a started. One of which was smoked salmon and it is a large portion of the best smoked salmon I have tasted in a long time. Their main course, haddock and salmon, was just as good as my cod.For pudding I went for the spotted dick with custard - diveine!The service is fast, friendly and now overpowering like many other places. Many shops may call themselves the 'best fish and chip shop in London', but Seashells really is the best"
"This restaurant is not fancy to look at ,but the food is simple and very good,reasonably priced as well,the staff are very attentive but not too much,there is a little bar if you wish to have a drink first,iwould strongly recommend to book as it is a small restaurant but gets packed,understandably .We had porcini risotto ,and ravioli with prawn and crab meat to start ,I loved my ravioli best starter out of the two I think,but my husband was happy with his,we also ordered a tomato and onion salad tofo with the starter and it was freshly made.For the mains we had a lamb shank, also a calves liver with butter and sage,lovely flavours,they both came with veg of the day which was saute pots and broccoli.(the only gripe was I asked what the veg was and my husband doesn't eat broccoli there was no other veg choice),We had cassatta which we shared after.We had 5 alcoholic drinks between us the bill came to a reasonable 67 pounds.Ialso hear it does tastecard ,so will aso try a weekday.Overall very good I would score 8 out of 10.Well done"
long queue to check in! took three quarters of an hour to check in! hotel staff did try to put it right by bringing drinks around!
"This Strada was a logical choice for enjoying Strada's Valentine menu, because of the excellent experience at our previous visit and their appealing location at the entrance of St. Katharine's Dock. We were fortunate to be able to choose the quiet corner table we occupied on our previous visit. Sometimes, when you return after some time to a restaurant, where you had a satisfactory experience, expecting again good food and attentive service, disappointment is the result. I must say, Strada St. Katharine's Dock passed this test with flying colors. The menu was sufficient varied, the food was well prepared, the service attentive and the beer was cold. Sitting down at Strada St. Katharines Dock and enjoying the food and the service brings you to a state of mind that only giveing a five point rating on TripAdvisor will do. Highly recommended."
"We have decided to have a brunch at Oscar, it was a fantastic idea! The staff was very kind with us, even switching off the air conditioning on request. The brunch was awesome, and the place is fantastic, not too classy, at the right level to feel comfortable. I highly recommend this place !"
"the fish and chips was not good as usual, a bit to dry, but the Calamari were the worst I ever tried.We got them, we saw them and smiled. They had not taste at all apart of the the heavy fried oil taste. Surely they were not fresh and they have been fried with overused oil. I mentioned to them, they kindly changed them, but they brought to us the same kind of Calamari. Disgusting"
Me and my friend went to this restaurant for dinner after reading some good reviews. There weren't that many customers (like 15 to 20) and four waiter/waitresses. Despite this we had to wait for being served in the first place and I didn't feel welcomed at all. We waited long time even for just drinks and then again when we wanted to pay. We got the bill and after like 15 minutes of waiting we went to pay to the bar. This shouldn't happen at Hilton's restaurant. The staff could be more nice as well. The food was delicious thoughÜ! I had mackerel and my friend had duck and both of these were really good and tasty.
"Relaxed atmosphere, great service, good simple French food, cooked to perfection and accompanied by an exciting and superbly priced wine list. Looking forward to the new 28 50 in Marlyebone. If you go out ""to be seen"", this ain't the place for you. If you go out to taste and drink quality at a fair price, 28/50 is heaven!"
"I know what you are thinking ""she just doesn't get it"" and yes I do know what good food is. Roka is good food for sure, but not great. The tasting menu has some really weak dishes, finishing off with what is a lazy dessert.We were made to wait for ages between dishes, it doesn't matter how busy the restaurant is, that is not what you expect for a £140 meal.ive spent a lot less money and been a lot more satisfied when eating Japanese food, Roka was just not what everyone had bigged it up to be."
"Being a local to Wimbledon, this is a restaurant that I have been to from time to time over the years, and on this occasion, I was tempted in once again by the beautiful and scerene dining room which has clearly been given a refresh recently. It looks like a scene from a 70s David Hockney painting - large colourful paintings adorn the high spacious room and table lamps give the room an enchanting glow. We opted for the set dinner menu at £24 and what a delicious meal we had. Extremely generous portions of delicious food Arrived, each one reminding us of the home cooked flavours we have experienced in inns in Italian villages. Delicious. The service was also exceptionally good, professional, discreet yet friendly. Diego, the general manager and very charming host, came over to our table to introduce himself and offer us glasses of limoncello as a digestif. A super evening. Thank you San Lorenzo!"
"It was a delicate restaurant with a semi-circular sofa surrounding the table and a perfectly organized table. The service was pretty good, all of them were very polite and understood, we all were foraigners. It's an Italian restaurant with the typical Italian food in the menu. It wasn't as eat in Italy but it was close. It is a medium-high price level although you might have in mind it is near a touristic square."
"Recently attended a priveate party here (for the third time) and had a super meal, served well by friendly, attentive staff who couldn't do enough to make the evening special."
Accompanied family member who is a vegan. Rather expensive for a toasted sandwich and £3 for 2 small truffles listed as a dessert. Not happy about 12.5% added as service charge. Felt as though staff trained to talk you into spending more. Will not return as more reasonably priced restaurants in the area even at London prices.
"Came here for lunch after reading all the Tripadvisor reviews. Was not disappointed at all. Good food at good prices, with fresh and well presented sushi. Curry laksa was massive so we just shared. Very spicy and tasty! Staff are really warm and friendly as well. Would definitely come back"
"Book table by window for memorable night time views.Pricey,but classy,faultless food.Looked after by friendly,professional staff.Tell them if its a birthday celebration !!!"
"We have just returned from 2 nights in London..stayed in Trafalgar Square (Hilton) for my partners 40th with our 5 year old so we were looking for a good value family restaurant for a meal on a saturday tea time. We Arrived without a booking, seated quickly in the window and the staff were very good. Order was taken swiftly, food Arrived quickly and was very tasty. Our waiter was so sweet, very attentive without being over powering. Very very good value for London. The breakfast menu looked ace too!!! Would defo recommend and return"
"I went here for my birthday with my partner. We sat in the bar first for a drink which had some traditional music on the stereo and a fan going to keep us nice and cool. Then we moved into the main restaurant which had all the doors open for summer which was lovely. We ordered calamari, antipasti and garlic bread for starters and pizza and cannelloni for main, massive portions and very good quality. Will be telling all our friends and coming back!"
"First plate was a mini array of deep fried items and a smoked salmon canape. Looked awful - like items from an Iceland Xmas medley . Followed with OK mini pizza , leavably bland meatballs and very poor duck ragu. When waitress asked how we liked it our comments were ignored, paid bill and left, disappointing...."
"Italian tapas is a brilliant idea. Italian food is much nicer than Spanish. Also, I'm notoriously bad at ordering so I'm happy to be somewhere that allows/encourages me to pick at your food.Our group was mostly vegetarian, otherwise I would have ordered meatier things (like the pigs head crostini).The best things were: * Crab arancini - these were melt-in-the-mouth. If you have a shellfish allergy, these are worth the risk.* Chickpea/spinach/ricotta meatballs. Now, ""chickpea meatballs"" sounds uninspiring and falafel-esque but these were wonderful, even better than beef meatballs. Other things we tried:* Fritto misto was crunchy-battered fishy things (I think mostly squid, there was definitely something with a lot of tiny tentacles). I liked this a lot.* Duck ragu, black olives, gnocchi. This was excellent - I was surprised by how well the black olives went with the duck. But it was quite heavy with the gnocchi, definitely a winter dish.* Pizzette. This was huge and the base was very thin, like a poppadum-texture. I tried it but it wasn't very exciting - I'd rather have an actual pizza, I think.* Grilled foccacia - very nice, a bit panini-ish. Foccacia is often puffy and dry, so grilling and oiling it is a great idea.* Fennel, almond and curly endive. A fab green salad with an incredible dressing and tangy parmesan."
Ate here with a close friend and his wife who had enjoyed it before. Great food and atmosphere. Near Chancery Lane.
"Went here for lunch. Reminded us a bit of Johnnie Rocket in Santa Monica. The service was fast & friendly. The food was nice, especially my banana & butterscotch milkshake."
"Goucho is an excellent restaurant in a great location. Atmosphere is good, very popular...and decent value for central London"
"Went with two friends and found the staff aggressive and useless - had no knowledge of the menu at all. Food was disgusting - in fact my food was off and we all tasted it and agreed. The manager came over and actually argued with us and took the food away uneaten, and then insisted on charging for inedible food. None of the food was nice - it was by far the worst meal any of us had ever had. Really cant recommend this restaurant - food very bad and the service worse and there was water pouring down from a leak in the ceiling near an electric switch with the staff standing around watching it. Friends ate here awhile ago and said standards had obviously fallen drastically since - wont ever return."
"Went to a friend's birthday here and it was perfect: the wine list is fabulous - great value and lovingly well-considered - and the venue is classy without being pretentious. Friendly team, a good range of sharing boards and central location - will definitely become one of my go-to evening drink spots."
"The cocktail menu is two blackboards across and the staff know each one like the back of their hands. The cocktails themselves come in huge glasses and, while not featuring any special ingredients, are mixed perfectly. The best part is they're no more than £8 which is crazy for Shaftesbury Avenue. ive been once while it was quiet and once on a Saturday night and both times ive been served really quickly and got a seat. Music was great on Saturday. Love this place!"
"The food here is truly fantastic, and the service was excellent. We used a Travel Zoo voucher @ £62.00 for two people. This gave us a 3 course dinner and a cheese course plus 2 cocktails on arriveal. It was an absolute bargain, we were able to pick from the normal dinner menu, and the food was excellent. There was a great range of cocktails and they were delicious. The food was stunning in both presentation and taste. Even without the voucher this place is well worth a look since the normal 3 course menu is only £38, and is well worth this. All the staff were lovely, very friendly and helpful, and attentive without being intrusive. Overall this is an excellent venue, lovely staff and amazing food."
Eggs benedict with ham for breakfast. Absolutely gorgeous and first class service. Whatever was on the menu looked good too!
I only went passed here when visiting the British Museum. The place was quite busy from the outside so I thought they must be busy.After my visit at the British Museum I thought I head down to Freud cafe. I had a lovely croissant made from scrath and a delicious coffe with wipped cream. Service was excellent and fast. Considering how busy it was I was never rushed. The women at the counter offered free incentives along with the coffee.Keep it up guys.
"I was a bit skeptical to try this place (it seemed overpriced for nepalese food and there weren't many customers during the weeknights) but after hearing friends rave about this place we decided to give it a try. We ordered the lamb momo, and it comes with the same delicious sauce that ive had in Kathmandu. The only downer was that there were only five pieces- a few more would be nice as a starter. the Khasi Tang - slow cooked lamb knuckles- were beautiful- falling off the bone. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Looking forward for my next visit."
I love this place. Staff are so accommodating and best chippie for miles.Need to keep away as I am often there three times a week....!!!
"I have been going to that place for two years at least once a month. Since mid last year, they have changed either the management, the cooks or something, but now it's much worst. We used to be able to eat in an hour or so when it was not too busy but the last three times ive been there, have been worst each. The last one, today. We were there at 12.10pm for lunch (empty restaurant), didn't get any starters till, at least 12.30pm and finished at 1.30pm a normal lunch of one starter and one main! Not even dessert or coffee!Plus, up to last year they used to give 4 dumplings. Now they are three...Even though it's close to the office, I think I am done. Not recommending it."
"This is a beautiful place to sit; the decor is excellent, the restaurant spacious and not too crowded. The menu seems good, but we had poor sea food for both starter and main. A disappointment. Perhaps we should have stuck with the pasta and pizza dishes. Hard to rate as all very good except the food we ordered. might try again, avoiding the sea food. A shame, as Wimbledon needs more places like this.Husband had sashimi ruined by overcooked tasteless (obviously frozen) prawns; a risotto that was in effect a tiny bit of rice at either end of more of the same prawns. Friend had the lobster spaghetti- pasta evidently not made in house and the meal was unfinished. Perhaps they had a different chef on, as others seem to have had good experiences here. But it was a Saturday night- should have been better than this, for the big money we paid."
"Lovely staff, delicious food and great prices. Nothing is too much trouble and they always make you feel so welcome! Great deals in the week as well!"
"I have been going to Gurkha's for several years now, and I have yet to find a better Indian Restaurant anywhere else in London.Staff are extremely polite and the food is consistently excellent. I have never ever had a bad meal here.They have seasonal menus and food is always made of high quality ingredients and is freshly cooked.I cannot recommend this place enough."
"Union Jacks never disappoints. The food is fantastic from the thin crust artisan pizza to the best fish and chips and salads. Jamie Oliver always presents the best to his patrons and this lives up to his brand. The setting is in the middle of Covent Garden which is in a covered area yet open to the atmosphere so it can get cold- but don't worry as the seats are heated so you are comfortable. The drinks are delicious, the service is excellent as well as the value. We have been there many times and will go back. Highly recommend"
"Small toilet tucked nicely around the corner, behind a black curtain for discreet access. Modern look, clean environment and powerful hand dryer. Good sink. 4 stars"
Il Cavaliere serves decent Italian food and reasonable prices but lacks on atmosphere because of a lack of customers. Why? I can only think it's because of it's slightly out of the way location. If you want a decent meal and good place to talk this is great though. Avoid match days at Arsenal though as it'll be packed then.
"Visited this retaurant last week. Unfortunatly the whole experience was really dissapointing. The host at the front of house was bored and unfriendly looking. Our waitress on the other hand was very friendly, so much so that she sat down beside us while taking our order, I found this really uncomfortable.We ordered some fizzy wine but were told that there was no champagne glasses available and if we wanted we could have our fizz in a pint glass??? Eventually waitress came back with newly bought champagne flutes, she informed us that she just went and bought them. The fizz was delicious tho . We both ordered the chicken dish which was served Luke warm, when we td the waitress she took both dishes back to the kitchen and fresh meal were then prepared again. Which was fine. The weird thing was that our waitress kept walking past our table and saying ' oh look at the steam coming from that chicken now ' really strange experience from beginning to end. I'm sorry but I don't recommend this restaurant and u am truly gutted as I live Jamie Oliver."
Great atmosphere and service! Good was excellent. We felt very welcome and would definitely come back again.We had the nasi goreng and the pad Thai which was lovely. They also have all you can eat dim sum on Sunday's which we're super excited about. See you Sunday!!
"I had been to Loulou's several times as a guest of a member. The staff are very nice and attentive. On one occasion, one waiting staff looked for me to inform me that a table had become available should I wish to be seated at the courtyard. I went to the courtyard for a smoke and commented to my friend of the need for more tables. My favourite sections to lounge are the library and the ground floor bar. The library has very comfortable couches, the bar has a very friendly vibe. The club in the lower ground seems always packed, great place to dance and let your hair down in the company of gentlemen and well-heeled ladies!"
Very good service and unlimited champagne. Don't go expecting a meal as it is afternoon tea as the name suggests and ment to snacks not a 3 course meal. I really don't know how any one could complain about the service food and amazing value for money. I would definitely return to try out a meal from the menu and they had an offer of steak and chips and half bottle of wine for £16.00 so cheaper then many pubs with average grub. Also a very clean well run restaurant and we visited when it was packed for lunch on a Saturday.
Just returned from a pleasant lunch with 2 work colleagues. The food was nice (I had fishcakes and mash) and although the resturant was full the service was good (this maybe because we had ordered before the rush?).There was a good atmosphere and the tropical fish tanks definitely add to the experience. This is clearly an institution given the number of people and the clientele but I feel the food is too expensive for what it is.Be prepared!
"Nice meal, drink and locale BUT then spoilt by stink of smokers sitting in non-smoking areas and puffing away. Staff not helpful at all. Will not be returning"
"We orders on valentines day a curry to be delivered that evening at 6.30. At 3.30 the curry Arrived. We told the driver it was way to early and he left the food and told us to contact the restaurant. We tasted the papadoms which were so stale they were indelible . We contacted the restaurant and they said next time we ordered they would give us free papadoms. We said this wasn't acceptable as we didn't have any for that evening. They agreed to send some at 6.30 that evening. We heated the food up in anticipation, by this time the onion bahjees were like bullets and the lamb chops like shoe leather. At 7pm I called the restaurant and was assured thy would be with us any minute. We ate the food which was completely ruined by this stage having been sitting around since 3.30. The papadoms finally Arrived at 7.40, long after we finished eating. Needless to say we sent them back with the driver. Thank you yak and yeti for ruining our valentine meal. The manager had said as they were so busy he would call me the next day to resolve the matter. A week later, I am still waiting!!!"
"we were a group of 5 , looking for a nice chilled place to stay for an hour or two: we hads the luck to try this lebanese place, noura, i am very glad we did so, it is a family run place, staff is full of kindness and we ere treated like kings by the whole team, the 2 chefs that made our wraps, the waiter and also the manager running the show!i will definitely return and enjoy that great food again . many thanks for your hospitalityDan"
"I came for lunch with 2 friends after a museum trip. The restaurant is quirky, theatrical and has very interesting loos! There are kiddy toilets downstairs though. The food is good, the menu is varied but not too expansive, and reasonably priced. Friendly staff and definitely worth another visit."
"Went here for lunch on a chilly Saturday in April. have been to this chain before and it's fine. However, everything about this branch was excellent. Really friendly staff, cosy interior, and brilliant food. I had the Penne Bufala and was even given a taste of the parmesan cheese, which was delicious! The whole atmosphere was warm and welcoming and this seemed to lead to different diners talking to each other too. Would definitely recommend and hope to return, I don't think I had appreciated how much these chain restaurants can vary until now :) Also, conveniently sited near the Tower of London and Tower Bridge if you're doing the whole touristy thing!"
"I totally enjoyed this restaurant. The food was delicious; the service great, and the atmosphere was lovely."
"Look, the food here (bistro) is okay, but nothing special. I had essentially a pork chop marinated in a tasty but not special marinade, served with a pile of salad leaves and a small side. This was upwards of GBP20 which is steep for wat it was. The entrees or so called nibble/tapas style plates were also pricey for what they were and the size. The killer though were the wine prices. Why is wine in restaurants like this so relatively expensive in London? GBP40 is pricey for a bottle of wine we would pay half that price for in Australia, but maybe we are spoiled! Go here if you want ok food but not if you yearning is for something distinctive. We ended up paying GBP113 for two people, and this is over the top for what this place is. The service we had was really good, so very well done on that front."
"We chose this on the basis of location and good reviews. We were entertaining friends and wanting somewhere with good food and a relaxing atmosphere. The restaurant met these requirements very well and we were not disappointed.Service was excellent throughout, unhurried but attentive, just what we wanted. Food was well presented. Roast beef was very tender but not particularly tasty. I agree with a previous reviewer that portions were on the small side. My wife enquired about vegetables to go with her sea bass. It was pointed out that the few vegetables provided were hiding under the fish.Agree with previous review that a table overlooking the park is desirable."
"This is a very good bar/restaurant where the emphasis is on the exceptional wine list. There are two parts to the list: a selection of good-value wines by the glass, carafe (25cl) or bottle; and a more rarefied selection of fine wines by the bottle. There are the usual stars from Bordeaux and Burgundy but also good representation of other regions and the pricing is fair. The food is pretty good, with a modern French influence. Service is efficient and friendly. Atmosphere is relaxed and informal. Highly recommended."
"I have been there last week. We found this restaurant just by a chance while we were shopping and we were exhausted we started to look for a place for dining. As it had a nice atmosphere we taught that it might be a good place. We were not wrong, their menu is quite good and also their starters and pizzas are very delicious. Especially strawberry cheesecake is magnificient! Do not miss it. It is not an expensive place in London. At least a good italian restaurant example. If you want to eat pizza or pasta this might be a good choice. Service level is in average, they are fast but... do not expect too much."
"The Angel Inn is a great pub and our favourite in Highgate. The atmosphere is lovely, service always friendly, the selection of drinks (including wines) is very good, and the food tasty. They also have free wi-fi which we took advantage of after moving into the area but before we had internet. Will definitely be back for more."
Service was a little slow but they were serving about 20 of us. The food was high quality gastro pub fare and the decor is relaxed but quite trendy. What you'd expect in Shoreditch! Recommended for lunch.
"We really like this pub, its got really friendly bar staff and a friendly local atmosphere. However it is let down by its prices (£5.80 for a cider is too expensive even by London standards!!) and the food (we had a Sunday roast sharing platter, and it was no way big enough for two, and was dry and stringy). Worth a visit for a pint, but an expensive one."
"We booked a table of four for the Burns Night Celebration ( My hubbie being scottish), at a cost of only £55 a head, which included half a bottle of wine, a whiskey and four course meal.It was a great night. The service was excellent and the four course meal was very tasty. The piper piped in the Haggis, and the Robbie Burns recitals were impressive. The other people on our table were freindly and it was a very comfortable atmosphere.Great value for money and very enjoyable. We have recommended to several friends and will definately get a larger table together next year.Tip we went into the Pub/Grill next door beforehand, and it was happy hour. I ordered a beer & Wine and was handed over 2 of each an added bonus !!"
"We stumbled upon this Jamie Oliveier's restaurant while walking around Covent Gardens. My wife and I had a ""Woodman"" pizza and a Grilled Spring Chicken! Most memorable was the pizza was so simple, and yet lingered in our minds for the rest of our UK/Europe trip.Gotta go back again!"
"Been craving for good quality Filipino cuisine just a few months after moving here in the UK so I did my google research and found out about Romulo's. I haven't been to any of their branches in Manila but I have heard good feedback back home so I thought, maybe it's time I try it here in the UK. Decided to bring a date along and boy was I pleasantly surprised! The ambiance of the place was classy and the food was fantastic! Staff was attentive (special mention to the lively and efficient manager, Trini!) Since then, I have returned many times already and even organised a Christmas party here last year! And every time, I always left feeling full and satisfied! This is amongst my favourite restaurants in London! I highly recommend the place if you're craving for Filipino cuisine or if you want to try Filipino cuisine for the first time!"
"I had read the reviews on TimeOut and booked to try. The place was full, waiters very very nice and the food was excellent. It is traditional/comfy food, but elevated to a very high standard. The portions are nice and the price reasonable for the quality. It was a very nice surprise and we'll definitely go back!"
As regular visitors I would like to compliment our extremely helpful waiter on his charming and professional approach.Great Serrano ham.Some good salads as well as traditional tapas.Nice buzzy atmosphere.
"Decided to eat here whilst out in Covent Garden for our first year anniversary. Was told there was a half an hour wait which we didn't mind and was told to wait at the bar. I like a good atmosphere when I eat and the place certainly had that however it seemed too crowded and it was impossible to get near the bar. Tactical seat-grabbing was taking place from others wedged into the tight space which doesn't exactly make for a great start. Despite holding one of those buzzer/pager things I noticed there were several free tables available that could have been taken, thus freeing up space in the waiting area. Finally managing to get a drink cost me over £4.00 each before we were seated by the door where a cold draught was blowing in from the street.We both ordered chicken dishes, my girlfriend had fajitas and I had quesadilias. The service was prompt however the food turned up cold and I had to send mine back to be reheated. When it returned all the flavour had gone from the food and I could eat less than half of it. At a price of upwards of £30 for two drinks and two main courses that were undercooked I could hardly see what I was paying for and upon returning to our hotel we were both violently ill for the following 48 hours resulting in missing a night's sleep and nearly our train home the following day. This completely ruined what had been up until that point a wonderful day out to enjoy our anniversary. Very dissatisfied."
"Great food, decoration and people! We loved the space and the food. The staff was very nice. Thank you Ali for the best night in London!"
Dined here last week with friends. The atmosphere as soon as you walk through the door of Carluccio's shouts friendliness. The staff were attentive and friendly. Food was fantastic. We thought the restaurant and staff were so good that we visited 3 nights in a row. We had their set meal which was delicious and well worth £10.99 for two courses. Great wine list too. I can't wait to try it in Manchester. My friend almost set the restaurant on fire when her napkin caught fire on the candle. The members of staff took it in their stride. Thanks for making my stay in London memorable.
They also do a great dinner..this is really fresh well cooked tasty food. There's lots of variety. It's a great place for a group dinner - lots of delicious cocktails as well.
"Nice revamped place after the fire. So glad its back up again. It looks much better after the refit too. Looks more up to date. Can't go wrong with fish and chips with mushy peas and lashing of vinegar. After this big meal, you won't need to eat for the rest of the day. Service is great and reasonably priced. If you don't want to the sit down option, the chippy next door is great too. Order the fish burger which is scrumptious."
"Went here for a meal Saturday evening. There was a queue and the restaurant was very busy but the wait, which wasn't that long, was worth it. The staff were attentive, polite and there was a minimum wait for the food. The food was impressive, tasty and well presented.Go to this restaurant, you won't regret it."
"Visit the restaurant for the first time. Quick aproach at the door with a smile, we were 3 and we asked for recomendation to the waiter who clearly show to know the menu very well. The food came very quickly, well presented and very tasty. We ask for advice again with desserts and were all really good agian. The price for everything was according to the service a food quality. The waiter ""Colin"" very friendly. The ambient was in place, lights and music, toilets clean. Good food, goood service, consistant meal and dessert for £20, great!!!!. Will come back to try another dish."
I have been to the Morgan Arms occasionally over a number of years but my most recent visit was sadly disappointing. I found the choices on the menu unappealing - there were no specials. I eventually settled on the burger and chips which was quite tasty. The chips were French fries and had I realised this when ordered would have asked for chunky chips - if this was possible. For dessert I had apple & rhubarb parfait which was fine but not really what I wanted to eat but nothing else inspired me apart from lemon cake but that was gluten free! So sadly I do feel the food and options available are not what they used to be. Maybe I'll just go there for a drink next time- it's still a nice pub with a good ambience
"Visited Union Jacks back in June and due to a fantastic experience could not wait to return- should have followed the advice to never go back as you could be disappointed. We were disappointed. Waitress was patronising ""you do realise that's really hot""...eh yes it has chillies in it. ""Head waitress / front of house"" really rude- just moved a chair away from our table while we were eating without saying anything despite there being no clear reason to move it / slouched around the diners just staring at them doing little else. The food was just ok (chicken with Bombay potatoes) served bizarrely on small, green plates which looked like they were from the 1980's. Background music competing with the splendid buzz of Covent Garden. Just this time it did not work."
"My first time here, and nothing to complain about. I had a steak and red wine lunch, and both were excellent. I really liked the fact that the menu and wine list were quite short, which is usually a sign that freshness and quality are priorities. My expectation in that regard was correct, and the food was perfect. There were no unusual dishes on offer, but that is also good for business lunches, when you would prefer no nasty surprises! The staff were friendly and the food Arrived after an appropriate wait. I would be happy to be back for another good lunch in future."
"I have eaten here a few times, it is far less busy than all the hustle and bustle of Lordship Lane at the other end. It is always clean and has good service. There is a nice selection of food and drinks. I have been here with friends and it is also family friendly- quite spacious so good for little ones to move about. Also dedicated parking outside which is unheard of in the area! I definitely recommend."
"We were lucky to get a seat; had made reservations and it was quite full. The pizza is excellent; light, crisp, good sauce and toppings. For a fun night out with good pizza, try this place. The locals also recommend it."
"We had tried to book this restaurant, rather optimistically, on the day we were hoping to visit. They said that they were fully booked but that we could turn up, sit in the bar area rather than the restaurant and perhaps get a table as and when one became free. We decided to go along, and we were very pleased that we did. Located off Old Street, the Princess of Shoreditch is clearly an old building but that has been refurbished in a very pleasant style. Large glass windows and wooden floors make for quite a loud environment - so on a Saturday night possibly not the best choice if you are after a quiet, romantic dinner date! - but otherwise buzzy, cheerful and bustling. We were greeted as soon as we walked in; we said that we hadn't booked, but the waiter (actually the manager, as it turns out) said that this wouldn't be a problem; he had a couple of people in front of us waiting but that he would seat us as soon as he could. Fine. We went to the bar, ordered our drinks, and within about five minutes of standing at the bar, we had a table! There is a good selection of drinks available here; from good real ales to a wide selection of wines, though if you're a cider drinker there is slightly less choice. My husband had the mussels to start, and we both decided to have the Rump Steak for main course. The mussels were cooked in a chilli, garlic and parsley sauce and were delicious. The steak was excellent quality meat, cooked to perfection and served beautifully. There was just the right amount of food for us, particularly as we were looking forward to the White Chocolate mousse with the pineapple carpaccio. Demolished, sadly, too quickly. So, whilst the food was excellent, the thing that really topped off this visit was the staff. The service was prompt, friendly and highly attentive, though not rushed or intrusive; when it was seen that we were discussing what red wine to have with dinner, a small taster of the wine of the month appeared on the table without us even speaking to the waiter. We actually ordered two carafes of this wine despite it being one that we would not ever normally have considered, and it went perfectly with the steak. I tried a couple of my husband's mussels, and as soon as I put my fork down, it was replaced by a fresh one. Absolutely astonishing service. Cannot recommend the Princess of Shoreditch highly enough; ive already been back in the daytime for a drink and we will definitely return for food. We wouldn't even necessarily need to be in the restaurant as the atmosphere in the bar area was so good. Great place."
"Been here there second, order the Jose Jose burgers and my brother order the Robinson, had a side of rosemary chips and deep fried chicken skin. Both burger absolutely amazing but I'm not a big fan on there buns, looks like buns are brought from Asda (sorry) but the burger was cooked to their standard which is medium rare. Both sides was good and the service and the atmosphere what nice too. Definitely need to visit this joint. Guys I think you need to change the buns no disrespect."
"We popped in for lunch, never having heard of this restaurant before. My companion, a committed carniveore, had the lobster surf and turf, which he pronounced 'delicious' and I went for the crab cakes and a side of coleslaw. The crab cakes were good, not the best ive ever eaten, and the coleslaw was delicious. We had a bottle of some very nice white wine - Portuguese, I think - and the bill came to £64. The staff were really welcoming and friendly - they are a credit to the restaurant."
"Just popped in here for a drink before the theatre. Too late for food, but seemed very nice with friendly staff and a nice pint!"
"Really nice street food, cool outdoor bar, and slightly uncomfortable seating. Great place though, hidden gem."
"Great ambience, great food. The place is nicely decorated and very cozy.I ordered the braised pigs cheeks with black pudding which was superb.The only small minus is that the portions are not as big as I'd like but truly the taste is delicious."
"The noisiest restaurant I have ever been in and I don't really know why. Found it hard to hear the waitress. Shows it is a popular place anyway. We opted for the lunchtime offer of two courses for £11.70. Our starters were very good. The mains were unexciting, in that I had a minute steak and fries and my partner had a piece of chicken with mash but that said, it was all well cooked and very palatable and because of the friendly service and ambience in the restaurant we enjoyed our time there."
"We popped in on Friday night without reservation. It was too busy so we had to take a drink on the basement which was quite nice, though it might be a policy of pre drink so to increase the final bill but it was fine, the cocktails did not disappoint us!Next, we were seated on the bar where we enjoyed the tastes of some of the small dishes like the steak with parmesan, that really tasted like Italy,or the veggie meatballs with spinach and ricotta! The environment is also very nice.Would definitely visit the place again!"
"Our party of 5 ate at Wolfe's before seeing War Horse in the nearby New London Theater (3 minute walk). Reservations were made online at Toptable.com. Unfortunately at 5:30 pm we were the only people in the place so atmosphere was non-existent. By the time we left at 7:00 a few more guests had Arrived and you could see that it could be a very fun place for drinks and dinner. The dinner tables are on an elevated platform in the same room as the bar, which is scalloped and conducive to groups of 2 or three to be seated there together. We had plenty of time so did not use the fixed price menu and ordered from the main menu instead. Steaks, pasta, and seafood were all excellent. Prices were reasonable by London standards. Would recommend Wolfe's to others and would gladly eat there again."
"At my cousin's insistence, we visited this japanese restaurant on December 28th... I wasn't that hungry and ordered just a chicken Katsu, which - in all honesty - was nothing special. We paid our (not so cheap) bill and left; however, later that evening, I had to hurry back to my hotel because I was having a rather nasty bout of diarrhoea. Moral of the story? I wouldn't eat there again. At least, the service was polite enough..."
ive watched this place grow from strength to strength since liveing in the area for the last 4 years... What an amazing place. Good food. Good value. And best of all a proud warm owner who is so pleased to have you.
"Some of the best pies ive had, with great gravy to boot. A bit of a drive from central London, but well worth the trip."
really good sunday roasts - huge portions and a buzzy atmosphere also outstanding service well worth booking
"An absolute wonderful setting because of its location directly inside Covent Garden. The restaurant takes up about half of this particular ""bay"" in Covent Garden's Market Building and is completely open, giveing a 360 degree of the surroundings. Our waitress was about as nice a person as you could possibly find anywhere in the world. The rest of the staff that we came in contact with were just as friendly and helpful. We're not ""experts"" on traditional British fare. However, we do know good food when we eat it, and the bangers and mash as well as the fish and chips were very flavorful. The mushy peas had a lot of pizzazz as opposed to the typical mushy peas we've had at a more upscale London restaurant. The bangers and mash were topped with fried sage leaves giveing the dish a very nice taste. The meal was rather ""pricey"" but worth it. Just what you'd expect from a world-renowned chef's restaurant in a top-notch location in central London. It was good enough that we went back for dinner the next night."
"Excellent fresh fish and chips available to eat in or take away. This is a traditional British food which is made very well at seashells. However it is slightly more expensive than other fish and chip shops which are just as good if not better. This restaurant is not expensive, it is just more that others."
"After having a dinner in the restaurant on ground floor, me and my friends decided to try out a cocktail in the basement bar. It is quite funky inside and the Australian waiter - absolutely amazing - perfect costumer service, but the cocktails are strong - there was four of us and we had two rounds - trying something different each time, and they were very strong on alcohol - obviously for some it's alright, and why not?! But if you just fancy enjoy a cocktail with some nice flavour - nah, a bit too strong."
We consider ourselves extremely fortunate to have Hana as our local. It is consistently and predictably good. We were pleased when it re-opened and reassured they have maintained their exceptional standards!!!
"We went for a walk in Portobello market and found this place by accident. It's hidden on the side, you will need to enter the small arcades under the nice Portobello Garden sign hanging there (that does not look Italian). Food is lovely and authentic, and staff was fast and really friendly. I really felt like this is a family place where everyone from the grand father to the young ones seems to be helping. The interior is a bit on the kitchy side, and the place is really small, but it has great charm still, and we felt really comfortable. Bonus points for their open service kitchen with their cheeses, breads and hams exposed as they are cooking, which allows you to see your plate in the making, which we really enjoyed.We will be back to try more of the menu, and in particular their saltimbocca sandwiches that looked delicious"
I dined here on a Saturday night with a party of 20 and I was really impressed. the food was delicious and the service was excellent. We were seated in the dining room which is upstairs - the decor is really tasteful and the atmosphere was great!
"Gluten Free food seems to be such a hard thing to find when eating out so when I came across this place my girlfriend had high hopes. I left a comment on the my reservation saying that she was super excited to finally find a gluten free restaurant and a warm welcome would be more than enough. The waitress as we entered, Georgia I think it was, was so friendly, quoted my comment and got the meal off to a good start. Minutes later we had , again I think I remember the name, Joe (super friendly, Irish), well he came over with 2 glasses of prosecco, complimentary because he liked my comment and wanted to make our experience that little bit more special. Such a nice feeling knowing that they read what I had left on the booking and understood how excited my girlfriend was! The rest of the night was perfect, food was great, not having to worry about 'could i eat this'. Food was quick as well which was nice. Just wondering if there is any different menu on non-theatre nights? the choices were great anyway but for future reference :) Overall, cute little place, great food, unbelievable service, so friendly and warm. Highly recommended!"
"Having followed Deliciously Ella on Instagram, the experience was largely what I expected; beautiful decor, aesthetically pleasing food and really nutritious. The mixed salad box was very tasty (I let them choose the filings) and really substantial. The customer service really went above and beyond. It has a great atmosphere and I'd recommend anyone into healthy eating to plan it into their day to visit. Luckily I work near by :-). Prices are quite high but what you'd expect for the quality. Maybe they'll introduce some kind of reward card...."
"Go to Great Portland Street station walk down Great Portland Street and on your left you will eventually come to this restaurant. In the summer there are tables outside on the pavement. Beppe owns and runs this restaurant. Loads of crammed in tables (do not let this put you off) and most times the restaurant is rammed - because it is extremely good!!The days when restaurants were owned and run by their owners and not by huge organisations have gone, so it is good to come across a restaurant that does stand alone and IS run by its owner. This is truly one of those as is evident by Beppe rushing around taking orders, delivering food and getting his staff to give his customers great service. Pictures of the family adorn the walls, I did not ask what the one of a man in prison was about. On the way to the rest room look out for a picture of Beppe named ""I am the boss"".  The food is exceptional, the service is exceptional, the atmosphere busy busy and you will no doubt get to know the people on the next table to you. Prices are excellent considering the location. Everything about this restaurant is wonderful if you like truly old fashioned Italian family food.You will not be disappointed!"
"Dropped in for a late evening after work bite. Everthing was done very well, food was all very tasty and the wine well chosen. Service was friendly and attentive. Menu could be expanded a little perhaps but all food we enjoyed."
"The music quality will of course depend on your taste and the band in question. We had a fantastic evening being thoroughly entertained by ""Down for the count"". Was slightly concerned about previous comments regarding food, but we had a very good experience with scrummy food. A very intimate venue putting right next to the band. It's cozy and close with friendly staff."
After visiting this restaursnt for over 20 years with my family we all vowed tonight not to ever go back. The portion of fish and chips was comically reduced in size at the same price £16! The service was so slows some of my family got the chips and other sides after they eat the fish! We complained to a new inexperienced manager and she just smiled!! Never again. It was a joke. The place was fairly empty so no excuses! But then again judging by the price /value and service not surprised it's empty.
This was a special voucher offer multi course meal. The food and service was very good. The food was very tasty and more than enough. Would definitely recommend to anyone who likes middle eastern/Lebanese food.
My colleague and I ate here after visiting the Tower of London. I wasn't that impressed with our waiter. He didn't ask how we enjoyed things until the very end of the meal. We shared the scallops appetizer and I was disappointed. The scallops were small and there were only 5 or 6 of them. More cauliflower than scallops. I ordered the John Dory fish and it tasted really mild and fresh. Also had mashed potatoes and they were very good.I had a scoop of homemade ice cream that was delicious.
Busy restaurant but they took us without a booking. Very enjoyable meal and good service.The speciality of creme caramel was a bit eggy for my tastes but the rest of our meal was delicious
"Went for lunch with my girlfriend, taking advantage of the lunch deal.Burgers were amazing and the food came really quickly. We were served by a girl named Poppy, and she was brilliant. Really bubbly and friendly! Would definitely come again."
Went to this small restaurant in Islington with a groupon voucher .The staff and I assume owner were very friendly and made us welcome. The food was very very good. Belly pork starter very tender with nice crispy crackling!Paid extra for Sea Bass but wow it was one of the best I have had. Creamy lemon dressing gorgeous. Would I go again without a voucher YES.If the offer with groupon is still on I would say BUY it quick you will not be disappointed!
"Went here last night for a pre theatre meal. It's BYOB with a minimal corkage charge of £1.50, I had the Bruschetta (which was lovely) and my friend had the Fried Fish (wish they'd peeled the prawns, but the shell added to the rustic effect) to start, and then the lasagne and a Capricciosa Pizza. The lasagne was a little lacking in the bechamel and seasoning, but that's just down to personal tastes more than anything, and at the price, was more than worth it. The pizza was also simply lovely. Tasty, well priced and a nice little dinner (and by little I mean, the two of us proceeded to the opera incredibly full!). For the Starters, Mains and Corkage it came to under £30!All in all, good food, good value. I'd go again, I can see myself becoming a regular..."
"We came to Borough Food Market just as it was closing. We had a very long day and needed to eat having spent the day at the Lady Diana Awards with Young people from the Youth Project we manage. We were all very tired and had already been make to feel unwelcome from a neighbouring establishment. The welcome and support we received at Elliot's was second to none, we were unfamiliar with the dishes on the menu where the dishes are cooked in Mediterranean style and some of the ingredients caused alarm to the younger members or our party (Chicken Hearts - which us older folk were more familiar with from the days when you go giblets with your chicken) but we had an amazing meal and had the menu demystified. When the food Arrived we were enjoyed it all and ate everything including the chicken hearts! Everything we ate was a taste sensation and all of it was delicious. I have to mention Joshua, our waiter who made the whole eveing exceptional, with his warn and friendly manner and help throughout. We did have desert and that was really yummy too. We will go back when we get chance! Our visit although classed under business was not really as such as we are a charity based community and youth club."
"I don't normally review restaurants but I feel like I need to share this story. Everything was going well, food Arrived quickly and all; but then I decided to go to the toilet. I push on the first cubicle as the door is closed but not locked. The chef (who has just made our pizza's) is urinating with aprons and the gloves used for cooking on. He literally used the same gloves to make the pizza, urinate and then go straight back into the kitchen. God knows how they passed their food health check. AVOID"
"Had afternoon tea last Saturday for first time and it was a great experience. Staff are very friendly and attentive, tea was lovely and the selection was really good! Highly recommended and worth the price and travel there!!"
"Given the hot, hot weather in London when we were there, the Hispaniola bar restaurant is a fun respite on the River Thames. Service is friendly. Prices OK. Side order of fries excellent. They serve Laurent-Perrier champagne - a surprise for an establishment like this."
"Child friendly smart cafe I'm Tuffnel Park. Has delicious sandwiches and, more importantly, space for buggies and a room with mats and toys for children to play whilst mums have a minute to themselves for coffee!"
"I have recently moved to Shoreditch and have been to The Princess for drinks and it has always been nice and cosy with very cool and friendly staff. When my friend suggested we do Sunday lunch, I immediately thought of this place.We were not disappointed, roast was one of the best ive had in YEARS! Amazing.Service is great, nice and casual but efficient, with well informed staff.My new favorite Sunday hang out.Can't wait to go back!"
"So the evening started well, but sadly after the opening repartee from the waiter things sadly went sour.The ambiance was fine, and even the majority of the staff appeared to be disinterested in being there our waiter seemed to be trying his hardest to please.It is not however the general malaise of the place, the interminably long time it took for our first drinks to arrive or the tepid espresso martini that was so dire, but the food.Apparently we were to look forward to authentic Italian cuisine. ...""When we opened the first Carluccio's caffÌ¬ our aim was to provide great quality, authentic Italian food"" Well... that may well have been the aim, but sadly you will get anything but at this place.Imagine the excitement of expecting to eat an authentic pasta - al dente right? Apparently not, instead what was presented was a soggy, flacid mess. Honestly a cold tin of Heinz spaghetti hoops would be more authentic, and certainly more appetising.I could see the look on my partner's face, someone who loves spaghetti bolognese with a passion. This was not good! The waiter eventually asked how the food was and she was honest...The plate was taken away and they tried again.... the spaghetti itself was ok ish... but the sauce? You know the satisfaction one gets from seeing and smelling an amazing rich pasta sauce full of promise tantalising your nostrils and your tongue is literally dancing at the opportunity to taste? Wel,l this wasn't one of those moments.Watery, meagre slopIf you ever feel tempted to visit this place just think of the best lasagna you have ever tasted, remember the aromas, the flavours, the company and savour every moment. Then think ""I must not go there"", because if you do visit this place your fondest food memories will be destroyed - and you may not be able to enjoy lasagna again, because every time you try memories of the worst lasagna experience ever will steam wildly into your consciousI think that's enough, I'm sure you get the picture"
"just pop in by chance and was very surprized just to walk in ,Friendly staff quick service and good food.Prawn cocktail was great as the fish fingers mains good but desset was a bit of a let down."
"We found it quite pricey,and menu not really our taste, and the hotel is near to a great food outlet THE FOOD HALL it sells all manner of hot food at reasonable price ,cold food ,extensive salads ,, fruit , and anything else your likely to want to eat,its all self service and you weigh it all yourself , so have just what you want, it has a central pay point then food can either be taken out or there is a large hall where you can eat in and get hot or cold drinks, all very customer friendly."
"We enjoyed going there regularly during our week stay in London. They have a full range of sandwiches, salads, sweets and drinks for you to choose from, all fresh and made the same day, so no overnight stays in fridge :-) I am not a coffee drinker, but their hot chocolate serves as a perfect substitution for me!"
Had a steak and chips. No sooner had I ordered than it was on the table. Impressively quick. staff were helpful
Booked afternoon tea and when I went prevented me from entering because I wear the veil and said these are the hotel with the policy I went for the most luxurious hotels in London and theworld did not happen to be prevented from entering the hotel racist unacceptable
"A nice little restaurant and bar. Will not be to everybodies taste as decor is a little tired and money needs to be spent but the food is excellent and gives very good value for your money. Big portions, great taste, nice wines and friendly staff. If you want chic its not for you but if you want a nice homely Italian restaurant that serves good food then it is the place to be."
"I visited the Park Terrance on Saturday 9th May and as always was not disappointed, the food was well presented and cooked to perfection and the service was attentive, after the meal we went up to Berties bar for a few cocktails before getting our taxi home and was served by Vilmos who was extremely informative about cocktails and friendly as always, once again I am looking forward to booking my next visit to my favourite restaurant and bar."
Really great food here and at such amazing value for Covent Garden as well. The service was quick and friendly despite the fact it was a busy Saturday in the summer.
"The food was super delicious - every single element had meaning and harmony each other, the service was perfect and the view was stunning. I would definitely come back soon. Only one thing,, if the tea was more special, like using tea leaves not bag, I'll be more happy - but doesn't matter too much. It was the best dinner so far!!!"
"We came here for a Sunday brunch and found the place was packed. The service was a little slow, understandably. The food and drink (Croque Monsieurs, cappuccino, hot chocolate) was hot and to a good standard. We shall return."
Food was great like TGI's normally is but service was shocking.Took 25 mins for drink to arrive. When coming to pay there wasn't a member of staff to be seen and it was like that often! It's like they all congregate in the back chatting! 15 mins later got the bill but could ha e easily left without paying and nobody would know
Had only a short time to eat so choose sharing nachos and garlic bread.The bread was quite dry but the nachos were tasty.
"I visited here with a large group for a friends birthday recently.The sevice was fantastic, the staff were very helpful and organised - we each had our own bar tab card which made paying at the end very easy and there was no having to split the bill etc.The food was really lovely too - I had the fish for my main and it was delicious. The steak looked incredible too, as were the mussels that I tried. Really lovely pub, good atmoshpere and not too packed which made for a great afternoon.I'm coming back this weekend with friends as we loved it so much."
"Is it its location within a working market, its friendly and unpretentious atmosphere or the quality of its menu and service that makes Edwins a go to destination when visiting London? In truth, it's all three. I was introduced to this restaurant by my daughter as a good place to eat and chat near to London Bridge and am very glad that she did so. The restaurant is not large, but gives the feeling of a French market bistro (yes I'm old enough to remember the 70's and 80's!). Having said that, the menu is fresh and modern (apparently using what is available in Borough Market each day) and its popularity is testimony to its atmosphere and its value for money as much as its location.If you've got the time, give Edwins a try - like me, you'll be back for more!"
"Purchased several meals here, both lunch and dinner. They have soups, salads and sandwiches, some of which can be heated. Great place to get a light dinner when you don't feel like a restaurant or are just too tired. Bring it back to your room and relax."
"My friend and I really enjoyed the food, drink, music and ambience. Our table waiter was professional, friendly and up for good banter. This complimented our pleasant experience."
"Arrived at this place to be meet by family, so far only 2 children, well settled in with a childrens mini pack of stickers and games, to keep them occupied. The staff are very child friendly, (dosn't it make a difference). Staff where very attentive and could not have been nicer. Wine list very reasonably priced. I had just a main course of Goats cheese winter salad, the best I have ever tasted, amazing dressing over it. Most of the rest of the party had burgers, which when eaten where still slightly pink inside, and my husband agreed tasted realy good. We were not hasseled in any way to finish and get out, as you are at some of these double sitting places, they were very busy Top marks to them, we will be back."
"Been a few times over the years to a few different ones but really enjoyed a sunday burger at the westbourne grove branch. Service was decent enough but really nice vibes , not too busy and great burgers as always ! Had a chicken for the first time with zucchini fries but the highlight was the oreo cheesecake!! Really lovely lazy lunch!"
"I pop up for a couple of drinks, first round I asked at the bar for a woodford old fashioned all good, second round I asked a a waitress and she ordered for me a chorizo old fashioned, I ask again at the bartender and he maid a four roses old fashioned, no wayyyyy"
"I have been to the Wandsworth branch next to Cineworld in Southside many times over the years so this review is overdue. It is near perfect pre cinema eating....generous, delicious and excellent value. Even with the proliferation of new places to eat in Southside it is still my favourite. Strangely when I went to the Liverpool Street branch a couple of years ago you paid more for less food. 5 star review for Wandsworth."
Have been to the Tramshed more than once. Each time it has delivered. The experience is relaxed and inviting. The staff never fail to please. They make every effort to accommodate. The food is presented really well and is always very flavoursome. I like the menu as it doesn't overwhelm the client with choice therefore it is relatively easy to find something to enjoy. The staff make sure you are attended to throughout your meal. I would encourage people to take this restaurant in. I will definitely be returning. Still haven't beaten the scrumptious bowl of chips. Beaten me every time. The prices are also reasonable. See for yourself.
"Either luckily or the consistently excellent pub food speaks for it's self. The good booze selection inhabits a cozy atmosphere where locals clink their favourite beverage while chewing fat and new friends are greeted with a warm smile.Not the biggest indoor space, so if determined to eat at a specific time might be a good idea to plan ahead or roll the dice and take your chances.The service always makes me feel like a long lost friend and coupled with the aforementioned food insures I plan to keep in touch."
"Have been to Cote Brasserie in Brighton and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's amazing how restaurants can differ so much by location as this wasn't a patch on it. My starter of warm Roquefort salad was terrible, and I told the waiter as much but he didn't bother to ask why. I think there may have been the odd crumb of Roquefort on it but it was minuscule and you would have needed a search party to locate it. The blue cheese dressing was delivered in a mini jug and had an extremely watery consistency (it was just wrong and tasted more like single cream if I'm honest). On the other hand, the fish parmentier I ordered for mains was delicious. My husband ordered steak for mains and said it was perfectly cooked. Apple tart for pudding was also good."
"Stepping into Tom's restaurant was a lovely nostalgic experience, reminiscent of my London childhood in the 1960s. It's as though you're a member of the family who's just Arrived for lunch - in our case unannounced, which we now realize was taking a chance, on a BH Sunday. This place is very, very popular with local people and Tripadvisor visitors, and those in the know book in advance. However, the restaurant is within Hardy's Free House pub, so there's a chance of a drink whilst you wait for a table.The ambiance is lively, homely and unpretentious, and the service warm and friendly. The food is good, Irish/British traditional home cooking in generous portions, and there's a wide choice of beverage as the Green Pea is also a coffee/tea lounge. I noticed at least six flavours of tea on the shelf, including fennel. We're looking forward to going again next time we're in Greenwich."
Really don't know how this place and Tom gets such good reviews. He completely over reacted was very rude to my girlfriend over a misunderstanding (his fault) about the booking time when we Arrived (she had spoken to him on the phone when booking and he said it was ok to come between 1230 and 1 but when we Arrived at 1250 he was very angry!) He also told another woman to ssshh while we were there when she tried to ask a question about the menu. I'm not easily annoyed but ended up walking out of the restaurant! Guess we got him on a bad day!
"Ordered online at 7.10, eventually Arrived at 9 after several calls to the restaurant to ask where the delivery was. Initially told by restaurant supervisor that the order would be free due to the wait. Delivery man then returned at 10pm to my home now requesting payment. First and last time I will be using this restaurant. Disgraceful customer service"
"I have been going here for a few years and it has always been a good typical east end pub, but recently it has had an extensive makeover and is now a gastropub with its own micro brewery.There are a good selection of beers brewed in house plus two or three guest ales,the new kitchen serves good food for both lunch and dinner and the beef burger is one of the best I have ever tasted."
We were given tickets to kinky boots and a meal at the ivey grill as a Christmas present. We were not disappointed. The service was impeccable and the food great. I would visit again. Choice of 2 menus pretty/post theatre or their normal menu. Bang bang chicken was lovely
"I was worried about what I'd be eating, as this was my first time in London. I told my daughter this is like their fast food chain, but better. The sandwiches tasted healthy, soups are great, and prices reasonable. I think we had 6 meals in a weeks stay from here."
"Lovely little restaurant with excellent food, lovely wines & atmosphere. Our host was helpful & knowledge about the food & wine which helped our selection. A lovely atmosphere all round"
"It doesnt look much from outside. Even as you walk in you would perhaps think twice about staying, but time your visit correctly and you will immediately feel you are in your local. The atmosphere from 5ish weekdays and the few weekend visits i have made was fantastic. Check out the beers - some great brews here. Not only that but decent wines and a great gin selection. ive seen a poor bar staff comment on here....very suprising. I return here because of the pleasant welcome i get on every occasion."
"Had breakfast here. We were lucky enough on arriveal to be told we'd only have to wait 10 minutes for a window seat to become available. The view is very nice, but it doesn't have the wow factor that you get from top of the rock in New York for example. We had the set breakfast with lobster eggs benedict. There was plenty of food, and it was good, but they committed one of the great sins of dining by bringing my main course to the table before I had finished my starter (I'm no slouch when it comes to eating so I guess this was due to their need to turn over tables as quickly as possible). It all felt a bit rushed, and overall neither the food, nor the view could make up for the size of the bill. I'd hate to have been one of the many diners to not get a window seat. On the plus side, the view from the gents urinals is probably one of the best in the world!We are glad we went so we can say we did it, but both agreed we probably wouldn't go back again. The view is nice, and the food is ok, but it is no more than that. All a bit of a gimmick as there are better places to eat, and better views to be had."
"I met some friends for drinks/cocktails upstairs - which I think is Boston and 68 is downstairs? Or maybe the other way round. Either way - great service, cosy seating and lovely bar snacks.The table service was great with really friendly staff and the cocktails were some of the best we've tasted!"
"We popped in here for lunch and ordered some nachos and things to share.The ordering process was rather slow, plus we had originally sat upstairs (as there was a very strong smell of bleach downstairs). However we were then told upstairs wasn't open, despite the ""Seating upstairs"" sign and there not being a barrier to stop up.The food came quickly and was OK for a quick lunch but nothing inspiring to want us to go back."
"We visited today for afternoon tea. The restaurant and bar area is impressive and beautifully turned out. The staff were all friendly and very attentive. We opted for the gentleman's tea as we thought it would be a little the different. We were slightly disappointed when the savouries came out as there didn't seem to be much of it. It all tasted delicious but was over far too quickly. The cakes, in our opinion, weren't great. None of them really blew us away and the battenburg was a little dry. Scones were good as was the glass of prosecco. There is a huge market for afternoon tea and we have had much better in other places. The restaurant didn't really seem geared towards afternoon tea and seemed more suited to a conventional meal."
"I love the good coffee and croissants, they serve the food hot and the service is fast."
"It was a bit tricky to get there as it is a bit off the beaten path - close to the tower bridge, but you have to walk down an alley to get there.This is an Argentinian grill. Service was very professional, courteous and fast. Started with some starters - sausages, 3 different kinds of ceviche (shrimp, mullet and trout) and some beef/chicken and cheese empanadas. All tasty, but beef was the best. They age their own beef and we had a bit of everything - but I recommend the Gaucho tasting plate. Not too large in quantity, and gives great tastes of filet, sirloin and skirt steak. All were incredibly tender and done perfectly. Sides were average - tomatoes, mushrooms, fries, etc.Desserts were average. The chocolate ice cream, meringue sponge and passion fruit (deconstructed) cheesecake were all good.Their wine pairings were spot on and very tasty. They have a in house beer that was very tasty - the ale.Great experience and the tower bridge backdrop was very nice.Closest metro is across the bridge, tower hill or tower gateway."
"The first time I dined here it was for a sunday dinner with a group. The food was excellent and the service was very good.I was disappointed when I came for my second visit this week. We were seated and waited about 10 minutes to be presented with menus- yes if you're busy I understand, but in this case the delay appeared to be due to three stuff members having a good old chat. Then when someone came to finely take our orders she told us the lamb was not available, not their fault but given its probably one of the most ordered dishes and half our table were planning on ordering it I feel it would have been nice if we were told when they gave us the menus. They also didn't have the wine we ordered and our server did not really know anything about their wines, it might have been nice if she offered to get someone who could help us. The food was nice but the roast lamb is definitely better than the roast beef we had to order. Finally when we ordered dessert again one of the two we ordered was not available-.All in all I have had one excellent visit and one average, hence the 4/5. Nice place for a roast but for the price their service needs to improve a lot."
"Honestly blew my mind!!! All ingredients are fresh and tasteful. The base is the best i ever had- thin and light, you just want to keep eating. Also presentation is lovely. Very good, easy going but attentive service. Well done guys"
"Over the top restaurant. You pass 3 people before even entering the restaurant, right around the corner of Regent street. Staff also over the top polite, but comes with the atmosphere. Drinks area, the gallery, all in pink, and another bar areas with dj, only in weekends i think. Bathrooms are the most spectacular part. I will not spoil this, but go!Very nice food, both fish, meat and veggie, large winelist as well as cocktwils. One of the best dessert ever, the choclate! Expensive, count at least 250‰âÂ for 2. Incl wine."
"The first time I tried this restaurant a few months ago, I remembered it being very good.This time, I ordered the steak frites. The steak was very dry. Fries were perfectly crispy and not oily.The chocolate mousse was amazing!"
A wonderful experience from the moment we stepped inThe service and advice when ordering was top classThe food can best be described as Italian tapasEvery course was superbThe menu changes so i will not go into great detailBe adventurous when orderingIf the salmon tatare is on make that a mustA special thank you for finding more grappa
"I love a quick stop foodie place that does what it says on the tin. Chicken shop/dirty burger does that with quality and speed. It is essentially burgers and chicken, but cooked to a top standard, served with a top standard and eaten with a big grin. When you walk in, it's like walking into an internal barbecue- brilliant straight away for me. Top wine, which of course helps, and helps the superb food slide down. Like I say, it does what it says on the tin!! It is fast food, but bloody lovely!"
"Pret is THE place where Londoners get their lunch. It's always healthy, fresh and original. One of my favourites!"
good Moroccan Ethnic Restaurant and no more. We were 23 people who booked this place .It took them a short time to get an invitation to serve and the service was very good. it looks that it is for turists only. The restaurant atmosphere and music were good and the quality of the products as well.but most of us said that Once is enough
"Had lunch with friends. Food and service were excellent. Had 3 course set menu for £ 20.Staff very welcoming and friendly. We were served by Nympha. The tables are set in a way so that you are not disturbed by your neighbors. Ideal place to entertain your guests in a calm atmosphere. Wine list is extensive, but we had a nice Bordeaux for £ 25.Best value for your money. Highly recommended!"
"About 13 booked for a team meal last week. It was the first day of the new spring menu - we had booked assuming we'd be eating off the previous menu. No decent meat option -no steak, lamb etc. I had ravioli which was over cooked and packed with olive tapenade which was not clear on the menu. Awful. The soup and dessert (crumble and custard) were ok. Service was average and where we were seated could hear the chef shouting from the galley below. Would not return and suggest others give this tourist trap a miss."
"I went there several times and everything was really good. I really love chilli squid.. They are so yummy!!! The last time I came there, there was something different in the food, did you change your recipes?I will be back anyway!!"
"This is a cool restaurant with a great atmosphere, good food range and excellent wines.An excellent destination for an evening meal for romantic, business or couples out together."
"I was recommended to head here by a friend whose house I'd stayed at the night before as I needed somewhere to hole up for the morning where I could sit comfortably, drink coffee and much on lunch. ive since been back twice more and have really enjoyed the delicious salad lunches, relaxed atmosphere and friendly staff. Next time I stay overnight in Streatham Hill again, I'll be heading straight here in the morning."
I visited The Angel with my Son on Friday night (Nov. 15th). ive been there before and have always preferred it for the relaxing and calm atmosphere.We had some drinks and a meal. I though the menu was innovative and the food very good. The service was very friendly and efficient. I look forward to going there again when I am next in London.
"We had one of the signature chicken and a huge tbone...awesome size, awesome taste!! All the sides were very nice too and the wine list is wide so you have all you need for having a great meal!"
"The food at Elliot's is served as small plates and is of very high quality. We had five plates between two people, which worked very well for us and was good value. Some of the dishes are quite unusual, and very delicious. For example, we had Figgitelli Peppers, Pig Head Kromeski (pig cheek croquettes), burrata salad and razor clams. The bread and coffee were excellent, and the service was engaging and informative. Highly recommended."
"Lovely cosy restaurant in Notting Hill. The owner is charming, the food outstanding, the service is good and ""familiar"". And the atmosphere is great, quite and familiar. The shangay dumplings are the best in London. Wine menu is good enough and cheap. I try to go there every 1 or 2 months."
We stopped in here to get some takeout because we were tired and hungry and just wanted to get back to our flat. Amber who served us was so friendly! Too bad all restaurants don't have someone like that as a first impression for customers. Burgers were great (I had The Don) as were the Rosemary fries. Scrabble-themed decor (loved that) and tight quarters.
"ive been to 28-50 a couple of times now, and had excellent food and wine on both occasions. In particular, the onglet steak I had on my last visit was really enjoyable and perfectly cooked. Unfortunately, my experience on both occasions was slightly marred by the heat in the venue, which was oppressive, to say the least. If this could be properly sorted (slightly better AC, and maybe a couple of fans around the place!) this would easily have been a 5 star review based on quality of food, wine, and the very good service."
"We went here on a Saturday night for dinner on a voucher we'd purchased. It's a nice restaurant but it was very quiet for a Saturday night. I had to ask for the air con to be turned down as it was freezing (not sure whyit was on so strong in winter) - with which they kindly obliged. Our waiter/waitresses were nice. The food was not bad but if more care had been taken with the finishing touches/cooking it would have been above average. I had partridge, which would have been nice but part of it was so rare that there was blood. I'm not sure that is how it's supposed to be so I just ate the cooked half. Ordered crumble for dessert which also would have been very nice but it was only luke warm, almost cold, which ruined it a bit. My partner's chicken dish was good, he said. So, I'd advise taking a bit more care with getting it right and this food would be very good. Our waiter kindly gave us a little wine top up as an apology, which was appreciated. If a little more care was taken getting it right I would recommend going here as generally it's not bad. One more tip, portions could be a tad bigger so you don't leave hungry!"
"Can't remember the last time ive eaten at a TGI's prior to this. Ate here on a very busy Sunday evening after a bike ride around town. Even though our waiter Rachel was very busy, she made us feel welcomed and was very friendly. I had one of the ice blaster drinks which was very sugary and I wouldn't recommend. Half rack of large ribs with side of prawns was good as was the accompanying onion rings although we did have to wait longer than expected. It was very noisy so not the easiest for conversation, but overall an okay experience."
"Went in for Sunday breakfast after staying in London for the weekend. Lovely fresh hot food, excellent service and a nice relaxed atmosphere."
"By far, our favorite place to eat breakfast at when we come to London. We fly from Qatar ( where we live) to London ( around 8 hours flight) just so we can eat at this place. We have almost tried everything they serve on their breakfast and brunch menus and haven't been disappointed not even once. The food is very cheap compared to the quality of food you receive on your plate, the pancakes and waffles at this place are absolutely the best we ever tried ( we tried most of the breakfast places in London).We can't wait to come next month and see the new bar installed in the kitchen and try the new dishes they serve. We wish this place all the best and please keep up the good amazing work you do and of course our best regards to the chef."
"Called in here for a meal a week ago. We didn't book and took a chance as thought it would be heaving. The service was poor considering it was daytime and not busy. It was expensive and service was only slightly better than a takeaway. One of the meals was a steak JD style but it turned up plain, we also ordered a milkshake for our little boy and it took forever to arrive, disappointed really. This eatery is in a prime location and should be so much better. Not a great experience, mainly down to service."
"My husband and I (both vegetarian) came to this restaurant as part of a relative's birthday party. When choosing our selections from the ""party menu"" beforehand, we noticed that the sole ""vegetarian"" option contained Parmesan cheese (which is made with the lining of a calf's stomach). We queried this and were told that we could have their unadvertised vegan set menu instead. This turned out to consist of: a small salad of rocket, cucumber and tomatoes with oil and balsamic vinegar; a single ladleful of passable ratatouille, served without any accompaniment; and a parfait glass full of (admittedly quite nice) fruit salad. For this we were charged the same as the meat-eaters -- £25 per head. I'm used to being ripped off in omniveore restaurants, but this was the first time ive had to stop for a snack afterward!On the plus side, the staff were all very pleasant, and the bar had a decent selection of vegetarian bottled beers."
"The location is great with great views of the docks. The food is good although each time I have been the food appears to be getting colder. I have been to this restaurant about five times and notice each time that the staff stand around in a group, chatting. I am guessing this is why the food is cold by the time it reaches the table. Last time I went, the drinks Arrived after the food. I had to get up and walk to the group of staff standing around to get the bill. Poor customer service lets Strada down."
"My first impression was that the place wasn't over clean.The staff were ok - not overly friendly but neither unfriendly but goodness, were they slow! The food was also ok (just) but in my opinion it would not be worth a second visit. They didn't seem able to serve the soup hot despite some of the party sending it back - maybe there was a problem on our particular evening.The view was pleasant enough but there was no atmosphere apart from the diners making their own. Sorry to say I can't show any real enthusiasm."
We visited here after seeing a show in London. I wanted a small quaint little pub with great food and a great atmosphere and I was not disappointed. The only downside is that we didn't visit having an empty stomach as we had been that morning to the wonderful Maltby Street food market! The restaurant seating is up a spiral staircase and the restaurant itself is beautifully laid out. The food served up was delicious and reasonably priced. I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I were hungry. I would however recommend this place to couples or groups of friends looking for a nice little gastro pub in a lovely setting.
"My husband and I visited for a quick lunch one monday afternoon. He had the rainbow roll and miso pork ramen. The portions were very generous, and the sushi was good. The staff can be a little slow, but it was reasonably busy."
"Great atmosphere, great food, and great service.Admittedly the restaurant is not responsible for the atmosphere, you can't go wrong being able to sit outside overlooking St Katerines dock. However, they are responsible for the great food and the great service.There was a good selection of food to choose from the menu.I had the sea bass and my husband had the seafood linguini, both very tasty.Great coffee as well."
A great spot to eat or have a drink...decor is very cool. Food was excellent and some great drinks choices. Near bank station and very popular with the after work crowd
However unfortunately Sticky Mango did not light our fire! Our table was squeezed into a corner with just enough room to squeeze in and out yet close enough to feel like you were dining with the adjacent table. We chose the set menu and although a couple of dishes we superb generally they were mediocre. We chose the tasting menu as the al a carte was limited. Our quest for a good London Thai continues.....PS pricey too
"Along with my sister in law and 10 year old niece and nephew we visited Union Jacks for lunch following a wonderful day in London. I initially noticed that the menu was very worn and scruffy and the menu choice was limited. The location, however was excellent being in the centre of Covent Garden market, to be honest it was a bit noisy but atmospheric nevertheless. We ordered to Kir Royale's and drinks for the children plus a jug of water. The Kir Royale's Arrived in water glasses and the water didn't arrive until after our 3rd request. When we did eventually get our water it was served in glasses that were just out of the dishwasher and really hot and the water was warm and undrinkable. We made a fourth request for water and this time it Arrived and was at least drinkable. We ordered our food, I had lamb, my sister in law salmon, my nephew pizza from the main menu and my niece meatballs from the children's menu. My lamb was totally overcooked and dry and my niece's meatballs looked like dog food. The children's menu said that there was salad with the meal but the salad didn't ever arrive. After we finished our food we sat with dirty plates in front of us for about 10 minutes and once the plates were removed we sat for a further 10 - 15 minutes without being asked if we would like a desert. Once we were eventually given menus we were left again for about 15 minutes before anyone took our order. Fortunately we were having fun as a family so we were not bothered about being left waiting but it is so irritating to think that we paid good money for such shoddy service.!! My niece needed to use the toilet and it was disgusting with toilet paper everywhere and no soap. I just don't think that anyone should have to put up with this when visiting a restaurant. I really wouldn't bother trying this restaurant. Go to Jamie's Italian as the menu and service is much better."
Went here recently with a friend this is the third time I have been and I was looking forward to it until the food came out. The pitta bread was hard and not warm. The hummus was really good. The lamb that I had was not cooked enough and never fell off the bone like it had done in the past. The chicken was a little bit burnt. The couscous and vegetable side was really good. Service is great although I felt a bit rushed by the waitress but the male waiter was amazing. Considering we paid around £100 for the two of us (this does include wine) I was not component satisfied and in fact I made a stop at McDonald on the way home. So I was very disappointed.
"I was in a rush so stopped by to grab a bacon buttie before work, the service was nice and fast but when I got back to the office I noticed they had gotten my order wrong and had toasted the bread, I didn't mind and continued to eat it however when getting to the second section I noticed the bread was mouldy which is possibly why it was toasted. Very disappointed."
"Went there with my friend for lunch. We were allocated to table which was quite close to the kitchen then we can see how chefs were cooking.The steak was very nice , juicy and was the best steak I had been eaten for long time. The service was not too bad. Overall quite satisfactory and will definitely come back."
"It is one of my favourite place in London when I want to try an excellent fish and chips. The ingredients used to prepare the dish are very good, first of all the oil which is fresh and of a very god quality. The fish is really nice and you are able to eat a big portion as it is well cooked. The service is good as the waitress are very polite. Of course I will return there."
"If there were ten stars, they would all be for Gabriel, the barman. I seriously cannot praise him enough; he was attentive, friendly, professional and polite. He demonstrated his flaring skills, took the time to build flavor profiles for my friend and I, as well as to go off menu to craft us some of his own personal recipes which could grace the menus of any high end establishment. My friend and I shared the Meat and Fish Canapes, as well as the Wagyu and Foie Gras Burger and the Peanut Butter Parfait, which were both brilliant. A beautiful venue that I selfishly want to keep a secret, as I don't want to risk losing the personal attention that the staff give to their customers. Honestly one of the best afternoons out that ive had in ages!"
"This is a very busy restaurant, a classic Italian one, with excellent food and service. The staff are all very friendly and there is a good family atmosphere to the place. The dishes are excellent, they do a great range of pizzas as well as some more unusual stuff. Personally I like the simpler foods, the bruschettas and similar, which are beautifully presented with fresh herbs sprinkled liberally over them. It is also one of the best places to have an Aperol spritz, very refreshing! It can be noisy if there is a large group, but that adds to the overall ambience of the place. It is worth booking on a Friday or Saturday night, but the telephone answering can be somewhat erratic. Goodness knows what would happen if you had to cancel a table of ten people a couple of hours beforehand!"
"I am slightly obsessed with a good breakfast particularly with a good poached egg and I was very impressed with the food here! Well presented, extremely yummy and the waitress was amazing helping me out with great all the right little extras I wanted! Lovely tea here too. Very popular place so expect to wait, but it's so worth it!"
"Despite there being very few toppings and inconsistent from one pizza to the other, the pizza is delicious. The service on the other hand is poor. ive been to the Brixton branch several times and the last 3 times they have got our orders wrong! They look confused when told its wrong, the waiter stands there yelling over the table when you're trying to have a peaceful meal and they don't tell you how long it will take to rectify their mistake."
"My husband and I had a very good meal here this weekend. It has 3 course fixed price menu, but has an excellent variety of choices for each course. Relaxed atmosphere and attentive staff. They have a cocktail bar adjoining the restaurant. It is also wheelchair accessible."
"My partner and I come here weekly if we can. It's our favourite local pub. They have a fantastic Sunday roast, rotating beer selection, and board games. What's not to love?"
"After having read some negative reviews I was prepared for the worst but I was pleasantly surprised with this restaurant: only a few glitches (meat came medium instead of medium rare, they forgot one side order) but the food was really good, the menu was not banal at all, the service was pleasant and the atmosphere was relaxed (we were there on a Wednesday evening)The view and the location are stunning and I though overall it was good value for money (I also had a voucher)."
"Highly recommend as somewhere different to meet. There was a couple of business people who had chosen to meet there but was predominantly couples, ladies who lunch etc. The food was excellent. Service was fantastic. We had a WOWCHER voucher but were greeted as any full paying customer - the staff were really clear as to what was included and brought tap water without a snarl and very promptly. Really attentive happy service - asked if we wanted to share a portion of chips and made it clear it would be £3.50 extra. Really relaxing environment - a bit of wobble if you are there at high tide but that is not too noticeable - Lovely girlie place to have relaxed lunch - I think most people were there using the Voucher which offered excellent value er"
"I didn't like the treatment we received when we were greeted or shall I say shouted at when we came through the door of TGI's. We were trying to explain to the rude hostess who kept rushing us that the rest of our family would be with us in a few minutes but she wasn't having none of it. And ignored us, moving onto the next group of people. I can understand that it was a Saturday night and the volume of people they receive they needed to seat but the tone, projection and then her expression of us did not sit right. The establishment redeemed itself when we were served by the endearing, sweet and funny Ramone. He was very attentive and made us all laugh and very apologetic when they got orders mixed up or forgotten. The food was good, especially their Jack Daniel's BBQ Wings - these were to die for and well worth all the commotion earlier."
"Again ive been going to this place for many many years since the TV program of DALLAS that we all wanted to be back home soon_ and wanting to eat Something simple and good_ while the taxi waits outside_ do allow for take away 15/20 minutes or more_ depends at what time of the day or evening you reach the place to order_ well worth it. Very tasty.Lisson Grove: Very near Baker Street 6 minutes Ò St. Johns Wood 5 minutes and maybe from Piccadilly about 30 minutes_ or soPlace super clean.Staff is polite and good in their manners.The owners have changed but the quality of food it is always good same standards_ maybe prices have gone up increased, but the ingredients they use_ make the difference_ and in my opinion are good quality.Great also for a large group.It is not a romantic place.Just good old fashion British Fish and chips and fish cakes well cooked to eat there or take away to your home or hotel if you are nearby_ otherwise you eat it in the taxi. Quality Value: Great if you want to be sure you eat with excellent products_ oil e.t.c. Will I return? YES _ always have done so when back in London and will continue to do so until otherwise_!"
Excellent cooking! Pasta was al dente and pizza was great! The staff was very friendly and the service was great!
"A busy Saturday lunchtime is not the best time to look for a relaxing meal with friends in this area, but we achieved it at Strada. All outside tables were taken but we were shown to a quiet corner inside. Our order was taken very quickly with drinks appearing shortly afterwards. Our starter appeared within a few minutes and was delicious. The mains followed and we all had different but each of us declared ours delightful and the best. The friendliness and efficiency of the staff, the atmosphere the decor all made our lunch a pleasant experience we hope to repeat again soon."
"Currently working in Brockley, we three popped into the Brockley Barge for breakfast before our business meeting. Costs were competitive, breakfast was better than most, bacon with no fat on it? Unheard of, but they found it at the Brockley Barge. Highly recommended! Will be working in Brockley so will definitely be back."
"Had a great meal last week, having not been there for a while it was so nice to be welcomed by the staff, who commented on the fact they hadn't seen us for a while. The food is still great and for us is the best Indian restaurant we've been to. Quality of the food is great and the price is very reasonable and the portions are very good. We would recommend this to anyone wanting a good quality Indian meal."
"Having lived in Japan...I wasn't sure it would match what I was used to! It did, tempura, sushi, sashimi, rolls...soup. Everything was fresh, tasty, well prepared. A great place, without booking ! A bit pricey frankly...decor very simple...but what matters is the quality and freshness. Service ok, still waiting for my second cup of tea...haven't tried the bentos, as we ordered a wide spread to share. Surely the bentos will be great. Will be back..."
"Basically sat outside but under cover in one of the large halls.Very warm though due to heaters placed around the place.busy at lunchtimes and the grilled chicken was a delight.Nice helpful smiley staff made it all a good lunchtime stopover.Only thing wrong was the noise from the over loud street entertainer who had his speakers at full volume and wasnt that funny,but this is covent garden so..."
"For a place that does only two things, I would expect it to do it very well. Alas that was not the case! Went as a group of 6, some had the chicken, others the steak. The chicken was boring and nothing you couldn't get at a local pub, and the steak was average at best. Sides are terrible, with the chips really being the only part of the meal any of us even remotely enjoyed.Service was disappointing, with our waitress making it very clear she did not want to be there that night. There are much better places in London for steak and / or chicken..."
"I have visited this restaurant on many occasions over the last ten years and have always had a fabulous meal. Nico and his lovely family run the restaurant and always provide a warm and friendly welcome. We go for special evenings such as birthdays etc, and sometimes mid-week just for a lovely dinner on our own.The menu is excellent with lots of choice and is changed every now and then. Mostly traditional Greek type food.The fish is always brilliant (especially the sea bass fillets and whole sea bream), the chicken moist and tasty and the lamb tender and succulent. The beef dishes can be rather intense. Vegetarian dishes are lovely too. The staff will accommodate any needs you have and will mix/match to suit your taste. House wine is very pleasant and good value.The restaurant is well placed in New Eltham, close to the station and lots of parking in the surrounding streets. It is a very clean, warm and inviting place with an upstairs area used on busy evenings. I actually prefer the upstairs as it is quieter.A great place to go, you will not be disappointed."
"We were staying nearby and had been warned about this pub, but decided to have a quick pint on Sunday, the staff behind the ramp were very good. Decided to go back Monday for a drink and eat that evening... different staff and they were dreadful! The attitude when we asked for drinks to be topped up was awful. Hence we did not eat. Avoid this place - unless the Sunday staff are on!"
This place not only looks cool but is cool - from the moment you walk in and see the damien hirst cow in formaldehyde this place is where its at - Great ambiance and the food is awesome... There were 14 in total so we ordered a couple of whole chickens which were soo juicy and flavorsome.For the serious red meat eaters we ordered 1 KG Rib on the bone which serves 2-3 and a 1KG Porterhouse for 2-3 to share. It was delicious - even when you tried to carve of all the meat with the knives and forks...you cant help but pick it up with your fingers to really get the rest of the meat off the bone...
"We booked at the restaurant upstairs at this pub which was a few minutes walk away from the Hoxton Hotel where we were staying. The dining room can be accessed through the main pub or better still through the door at the side leading directly to the metal spiral stairs to the upstairs. This would be difficult to access for some with a physical disability but the same food is served in the pub downstairs. The dining room upstairs is small and intimate with candle lit tables. The tables and floor are bare wood but despite the bare floorboards the room is not unduly noisy and has a nice buzz to it. On arriveal we received a friendly welcome and throughout our meal the service was efficient, relaxed and always attentive without being in your face. All the courses were very much better than the average fare found in most pubs. The portions were all generous and tasty.We were very pleased with all of our courses and felt they represented excellent value for money despite the fact that it is pricier than the average pub meal. The meal and the service can be seen as a gastro pub experience unlike many that give themselves such a title but haven't a clue about service or cooking. For two each having three courses and a bottle of wine it came to £80.77 including the 12.5% service charge. This is now the third time we have dined here and each time has been a positive experience."
Was a weekend b'day Brunch so a bit busy and was not able to enjoy the front view. Hope we can be seated by the window seat next time.
"If you want to experience excellent service, pop around to this Cote Brasserie. It really felt like the waiters/waitresses were dancing around us and their genuine friendliness and attentiveness affords them the highest marks.I have yet to have better calamari - well done.Unfortunately the code strips were a bit mushy - thumbs down. Perhaps I should have had the sea bass instead :)Excellent venue, good value for money."
"I had been before for my 21st birthday a few years ago, my parents hired out a priveate dining room upstairs - everything about that evening was absolutely amazing.However, it would appear things have gone downhill since then...I visited in April with my rather elderly godmother, who I hadn't seen in years so it was a special occasion. I booked online but we were seated practically in the middle of the corridor - next to the waiter's plate collecting station. The waiters enjoy a loud conversation between themselves! The air conditioning was on (in April) and it was too cold.I asked for my beef medium rare, and when it was brought out it was practically blue - there was a lot of blood! So I asked for it to be sent back and recooked slightly, which the waiter did not appreciate, so we asked them to take both meals back otherwise they would be cold... I also asked for spinach with no cream, as I have a dairy allergy, the waiter did not appreciate that either and made me feel guilty for inconveniencing the chef.We eventually got our main meals back, not piping hot, which was tasty enough but not amazing for the price. We got the vibe that as a whole, the restaurant prefers men as we were treated with little respect. So overall - that table should not even be an option for people. It is in the middle of the corridor! I had raved about Rules for so long, following my priveate dining experience, but I was bitterly disappointed and frankly quite embarrassed to have recommended it. Will not be going back, and it is a shame as I had such a wonderful night there for my birthday."
"Great dinner, great service, great refurbishment. Well done! Looks much better than before. Will come again very soon."
"A long established fish restaurant offering takeaway and restaurant, the staff are so friendly, this place is popular, a word of advice is book first. They have a nice range of wines and if you can, book a seat near the fish tanks, they are great to look at whilst dining, most certainly my No.1 Fish & Chip Restaurant in London town"
"Really good, fairly priced tapas! Great specials - we had a steak and horseradish special that was absolutely amazing! Staff are knowledgable and friendly, they put a sauce on the side for us when they heard one of us didn't like mushrooms :) Only issue was really tough, chewy pig cheeks but the sauce they were in more than made up for it. Nice wine, and all come as a karafe. Lovely local all round!"
Highly recommend this place! Atmosphere is great! We were seated straight away. Fiona is amazing! It was my friends bday and she gave us complimentary shorts! Will deffo come back :)
We walked along the Thames looking for a place for a drink and we came across the Good Ship Benefit - it was great. Staff were extremely friendly and the deck had a great atmosphere. The perfect place in the sunshine for a beer or cocktail. I hope to visit again when I am next in London.
"Being a strict vegetarian and a sushi lover, it is exciting to know that there is a vegan Japanese restaurant where you don't have to worry about eggs and fish sauce in your food. The food in this restaurant is so good, you have different flavors bursting in your mouth with every bite. My favourite part of the meal was the different kinds of sushi they make and they all look so pretty. The dessert was unique too, we had the sesame pudding and it was delicious. I liked the 'set-menu' concept and the lady serving us was very friendly and helpful too. I would definitely recommend this place and we will be visiting again."
"We had a great evening say out in the rear. Took a while to order, and they don't have menus, but well worth the wait. Superb"
Amazing food. Great service. More than you would expect in a pizza place. A tiny bit pricy. JUST TRY PUTTING YOUR KNIFE AND FORK DOWN!
"Been there for lunchStarter were average but main courses really bad.Green chicken curry, one of the worst I had.Not going back."
"Me and the other half always pop in here after a bit of shopping... tucked away behind Topshop its never over busy & you can be in and out in half hour. Pizza is unreal, friendly service and great concept walking up and watching it get made etc. We love it here and highly recommend it... peace out."
"Once again I find myself writing a fabulous review of Chez Patrick! Every Christmas and summer I dine at Chez Patrick, where the food is dependably perfect, and the service/ambience is exceptional. Chez Patrick is a doll - he brings in a French charm that makes the experience delightful. Match that charm and lovely atmosphere with perfectly prepared mussels, beef bourguignon, soup, or anything else on the menu, and you have a perfect evening. Chez Patrick will laugh with you as you try to speak French, and he or his staff will tend to your every need. This summer I noticed that he served the soup directly out of a beautiful soup terrine - an elegant touch for such a humble dish as soup. Thanks Chez Patrick for a wonderful French meal in London! See you in November/December! We wish you would open a restaurant in Florida!"
"Been visiting Makan for years - best value-for-money lamb / chicken curry and rice under a fiver in Portobello. And try their Char Qway Teo also. Great staff, always friendly and helpful. It's a classic cafe/eaterie under the flyover on Portobello Rd for traditional Malaysian food. Recommended."
"I can just recommend this restaurant to anyone who like to taste the traditional British dishes in a special version. The drinks are also very nice, full of taste and VERY special. Very good value for the money!"
"This is my third visit to this place, this time was a group of friends on a birthday celebration, The staff were really great advising on sharing courses, carving and generally looking after us,we had a great night and the place was packed so I really have respect for the staff giveing us so much attention.Highly recommended and the food is exceptional"
"Elliot's Cafe had been recommended to us Ò along with many other restaurants in the market Ò and we were very happy with our lunch experience. We found Elliot's a welcome respite from the craziness of the Saturday Borough Market scene. We were initially a bit concerned that it was going to be a trendy place that treated food as an afterthought Ò but no! We found their menu creative and expertly prepared. Their format is ÷smaller plates' Ò consistent with the current trend in London, and they are brought to the table in the order in which they come out of the kitchen. We loved the element of surprise! The wines by the glass and beers on offer provided sufficient choice. Our waitress was prompt and skillful."
"I'm a coffee addict and London is an expensive city. 99p for a white filter? Thank you very much. The Pret chain is ubiquitous in London and a great value not just for the coffee but for the variety of food and snacks as well. And Internet. Friendly staff, very efficient and well, a cup of coffee that can be relied on."
"We had the 8 course tasting menus - £100pp. When the first course Arrived it was tiny & I immediately thought I'd be grabbing a sandwich on the way home. But the meal just got better and better - melt in the mouth. Staff were extremely helpful , the restaurant is tiny, so really only dining for 2 rather than a group. Would go again for a treat as it is very expensive - but well worth a visit if you love Japanese."
"We chose this restaurant as it was close to our Hotel and the Theatre.. The food was lovely.. Slightly over priced for what it was but not your average Chinese takeaway.. The drinks were lovely.. I recommended the raspberry lemonade!! For two starters, two main meals and 4 drinks our bill was nearly £45 but that's London prices for you.."
"This place is small and cozy without being cramped. They employ a no standing policy so that everyone can be comfortable and easily move around when need be without having to slide through a horde of people. They also close at 11pm, which I found odd at first, but it was explained to me that they would prefer to have customers who come in to enjoy the cocktails as opposed to a late night crowd that just wants to get drunk. I get it.Very inventive cocktail menu, including a drink with shaved frozen snickers bar on top, or peanut butter and jam infused scotch, but the staff were what made this place great. The German bartender, when I told him I would be in Berlin, was eager to give me a huge list of recommendations for cocktail bars, and happy to let me try obscure ingredients I had never heard of. It truly was a laid back inviting atmosphere, somewhere you can go alone and be treated like a friend."
My friends and I were in London for one day and Ruth (bar tender) welcomed us with wide arms. She talked to us and recommended things to do in town. We came back for dinner and found a great draught beer selection as well as great prices for food.
"Everything was right about the Club; Greeting, waiter service, sommelier and the excellent food. Atmosphere is right, with the correct balance between being polite, attentive but also humorous and friendly too. Please keep it up! The meal was all one would expect from this area of London. The wine list was more than adequate to balance the menu at all stages of the meal."
"I discovered PAM last year while in London. And since that trip anytime I go to London I literally stalk this place. I love their porridge, croissants, juices and shrimp sandwich. Their establishments are clean, very inviting and the staff are great. The food is fresh and tastes fantastic and reasonably priced. On my most recent trip to England I was staying 30 minutes outside of London. On the day I decided to head into London, I checked on line to see what time they serve breakfast until and made sure I took a train that would allow me to arrive in London with enough time to eat breakfast. Yup, stalker. :)"
"Went here with my friend, we really wanted to have a cheesetastic time. Ordered two of the vegetarian cheese toasties choices, Not enough cheese, not flavored with anything else, they were rushed and even the sauces they charge 50p for just doesn't add anything to the toasties. Come here for shattered dreama and disappointment, and if you're on a cheese free diet. Also at around £4 a pop, It's a piss take. Why two stars, cause it is still cheese,.."
Very disappointing. Berners Tavern came highly recommended and I can't understand why! The decor is very nice but that is about it. The meal was was too rushed. Starters were on the table before the wine was poured and just and quickly the main course Arrived after staff had clearly overheard us talking that everything was too fast. Service was nothing special at all. Just did their job like checking off daily tasks with no passion and VERY quickly. Food was fine. I ordered the filet and that was the best. The sirloin was chewy. Starters had no taste. Definitely not worth the money. Perhaps good though if you want an expensive three course meal with a bottle of wine in one hour.
"We went with friends on Saturday night after hearing great reports. Not sure how to describe the menu, an Asian Japanese mix. We had a selection of starts including sushi which was very tasty, the wine menu was simple and reasonably priced. I had the Szechuan Chili Chicken it was hot, fresh, lots of it and delicious. They have one dessert, low fat yoghurt with lots of different toppings. The bill came to £70 per couple which I thought was very reasonable and will certainly be returning."
"We came across the cafe by accident looking for a place to stop for some food after walking in the park. Despite the rather limited menu, food was of an excellent standard, well cooked and left a rather light feeling. We also had a bowl of fresh fruit which really worked and a very nice cookie. There was dog water and the dog could come in and stay with us. Overall a very pleasant experience and will definitely come back."
"You always end up back at Pret after a while, if yo're in search of tasty and fresh lunchtime food. It's pricey but, like M&S Food, the quality tells."
"Secong time eating here as they allow children in whilst dining. The food is very good, homecooked, and reasonably priced. Two adults two childens meals and two rounds of drinks. £60"
"My wife and I had dinner here before we went to the theatre last Friday.We were greeted well and offered a table. As it was only 6pm the restarant was quiet. We ordered a bottle of house red, which was quite good value at £16.50 and as we only had an hour chose a starter and main course. My wife started with bruschetter; a good helping and quite good and I had the stuffed aubergine which was quite tasty. We both had pasta dishes for ur main coure. I had asked them to prepare fettuccine which they did but the dish was disappointing.Sadly, not a restaurant that we would use again. The decor looked tired, pretty much like the staff!"
"We've eaten here countless times over the years and have never been disappointed. The food is of a very high quality and never greasy. There is always a wide range of fish available and for those who have commented that it's a bit pricy, all I can say is that they're not used to London prices. As another reviewer has said recently, it never lets you down and remains one of my favourite fish restaurants. Keep it up !"
Very poorly furnished and maintained restaurant with filthy washroom typical of the public toilet in Malaysia. It is unfortunate that it is called Malaysian Hall which put a same to my country. The only good thing is the affordable food.
"You know what this is a really cool place with an interesting menu, good wine list and excellent beers.Inside the place is really nicely done out.My main gripe was that the communication from staff was really poor . ...... Only having looked at the menu for 10 minutes did someone explain it was a tapas style menu.The food was really quite good and we had ox tongue, cuttlefish and gnocchi as our choices with a side of Maris piper fries. This with two pints game to about £60!!£6.50 a pint also!!!As I said the food was lovely, the staff seemed nice, the place cool inside but a little pricey and the confusion with the menu means I can't give a higher rating.If in the London Bridge area or near Borough Market at night check it out. If through the day visit the stalls!!!!"
"Although we didn't get a chance to eat here, the food looked great! We went in after a fabulous evening watching Chic at Fulham Palace. The pub was heaving but the staff had time for you - they focuses on you and you didn't feel rushed (there were six of us so getting everyone to make up their mind was fun ). The next morning my daughter found that she had lost her purse! Heartbreaking as it was her birthday and the purse contained her birthday money, cards and driveing license. We walked over to the pub before it opened to find that they had just phoned the contact number in the purse having found it on the floor near to where we were sitting). Everything was in there - what honesty is that! Thank you so very much!"
"This is a fabulous place, beautiful decor and really good food. The staff are wonderfully helpful and friendly - Ewa was our fun waitress and we had a thoroughly enjoyable time there.They also realise that families like to go out together and welcome children until 9pm which is lovely."
"It was our first morning in London and we needed to find a place to eat breakfast near the Westminster area since we had a tour booked nearby. After trying to find a place we ended up walking to Little Frankies near Trafalger Square. It's a cute little place that had American memorabilia on the walls. Kinda ironic since we are Americans and the first place we eat at in England has NY Yankees stuff all over. The food wasn't bad, but unique. I never thought about making my pancakes the way they had done it with intermixing multiple meats and fried egg in between. Maybe it's an English thing? It was good, but then again nothing that I couldn't do at home. Our server was very friendly and helped us get out of there in time to get to our tour. Overall good little find, but don't expect to be blown out of the water either."
"This is honestly the best place to eat in london - fresh food made daily and it is priced reasonably too :) ate here several times a day during our stay in London. They is nearly a store on every corner, so very easy to find :) please bring some shops to australia!!"
We thoroughly enjoyed our meal at this restaurant - the most tender and succulent chicken I have ever had. Great service and location too.
"This is such an amazing idea for people with young children. The playroom at the back is filled with toys and books, perfect for children under 3 (a little less for slightly older children but still a lot more fun than an average cafe) which are all kept beautifully clean by the lovely staff. The coffee and food are distinctly ""adult"", which is great - since the kids are kept out of the way at the back it's also a great place to go without kids as they won't disturb you in the cafe at the front. I wish there were more of these cafes!"
"This Nandos is in a great location. Near to shopping and hotels. The service was quick, with helpful waiters and food was great."
"We booked a set menu dinner using bookatable, 30 pounds each for three courses and a cocktail, excellent value. The food was delicious as was the cocktail! The staff were also very friendly and helped my girlfriend when she mentioned she was allergic to gluten, they even changed the dessert slightly to accommodate this."
"Reserved a table pouncer deal. We Arrived, the initial welcome was friendly from the barman. The main front of house lady initially contradicted the details of the offer, shouted it for all to hear when we sat down, argued with us as we requested no wine, and generally left us feeling really embarrassed over the nature of our visit.I like a good deal, but dont want to be made out to be a cheapskate by a tactless, thoughtless, culinary hitler who treats people like cattle.We will never visit again. Deal or not."
"Finally decided to try this for 4 people for a joint Birthday celebration, and so glad we did. The location is great, just opposite the London Eye. The whole area was very clean and welcoming and it just got better and better. We eventually decided to go for the set meal and we were not disappointed. The food was great and contrary to other comments on this site, we thought the portion size was more than adequate. The food was delicious and very well presented. The staff were great and made us feel very welcome, with a special effort made to help us celebrate our Birthdays. Very good value for money and a real pleasure not to feel ripped off in London. Would definitely recommend."
"this is a great option when you're short on time and want something much more healthy than a hamburger. A lot of options for sandwiches, wraps, salads, chips, soups, etc. Our only complaint is that it's a bit pricey for the amount of food you get. All in all we like it."
Had an awesome dinner here. The food was incredible - my taste buds have never been so alive!!! Well worth a visit.
"It may not have been the best food ive ever had, but was definitely one of the coolest places ive ever eaten at. I had pheasant pie for an entre and hare as an appetizer. Very delicious, but didn't knock my socks off. (the Guiness did.... oh my god... sweet nectar of the gods) But it's almost like eating at a museum... like Charles Dickens probably had pheasant in the exact same seat as you. and it is a beautiful space, completely out of time, making you feel like you just came back from the hunt and the staff is preparing the meat while the gentlemen talk politics in the drawing room kinda thing... the bill for two people was $220 with two glasses of wine and two beers, certainly one of the more expensive dinners ive had, and certainly not the best, but one of the coolest. I wouldn't do it again... but certainly have no regrets doing it once."
"Came here for post-work quick dinner and loved it. Definitely have the mac and cheese sandwich if it's on the menu. Not the cheapest for what is essentially a posh sandwich, but you won't be disappointed (or hungry). The Melt Room relish for dunking crusts is an absolute must, it's curryish and amazing."
"Reasonable service but below average wine and overpriced but tasty food. Dont go with a big party, even if booked as they can't cope.In summary plenty of potential but better established options available."
Good food...good service. Staff very efficient but friendly as well. Music good not too loud good ambience.
"My family has been to this restaurant 4-5 times now. The steamed lobsters and burgers are good. The lobster comes with a green salad and French fries. It's a decent value for the lobster. The service is spotty, with some waitstaff more knowledgable about the menu than others; and some making more of an effort than others. Overall, it's a good place for casual dinner, but we prefer the food and atmosphere of the ""Burger & Lobster"" chain of restaurants (where the food is better and offerings for drinks and desserts are better). The advantage of ""Hardcore Lobster & More"" is that they offer chicken, etc. whereas it's only burgers, lobster and lobster rolls."
"Our friends James and Mark treated us to lunch on Saturday - staff were brilliant, friendly and hard working - a credit to the owners.Food delicious - had problem with my steak but the staff sorted it our straight away without any fuss. Every one enjoyed the food - in fact we were all sharing. Brilliant."
"great little set up very reasonable price and size of portions enough to fill the most hungry,a good choice of dishes from mild to spicy.a real bargain"
Attended her Saturday with my friend for the free flowing afternoon tea ...was really lovely - staff really good about topping you up and making sure you get your moneys worth - great value and food also good ...could do with slightly more sandwiches but hey her for the bubbles !! highly recommend for great value up the west end !!
The three course midweek set menu is very good and worth every penny unfortunately it is served only Monday to Friday at lunch time. Excellent quality of ingredients and the location is also quite unique.
"Have been to Ibleo before and always have a great meal. The staff are warm and welcoming, the food is on another level compared to most local restaurants. It's a great range of original Italian recipes that are full of flavour and always cooked to perfection, lots of ingredients that you can tell are very fresh. Generally a great local family restaurant that now seems to be enjoying a good following. Many thanks"
"Myself and my boyfriend made a reservation for valentines evening as i love TGI Fridays and i must say, this one did not disappoint. We were seated swiftly (good job we pre booked as there was a 2 hour wait for walk ins). Our waiter (dean or liam cant quite remember but know he has only been working there a couple of weeks) was attentive, courteous and helped us decide our drink order - hr was very informative considering the little time he has worked there. Even helping us by offering to take our photo etc.The food was fantastic and considering the place was full to the brim, Arrived hot, Arrived promptly and tasted delicious.A big thumbs up from us for a very enjoyable valentines meal."
"We visited this place as it was always packed when we walked by.It was worth it. The interior,although small, feels welcoming and has beautiful decorations.The food comes in huge portions and always tastes like homemade food.(i.e opposite of McDonalds) I especially recommend the soup. The price isn't too expensive and would work for mid-range.The staff are good and offer takeaways if someone doesn't want to finish their meal there.All in all I recommend for anyone who wants to try Polish/Eastern-european food!"
Chicken served in Nando's is the best one in the world! Nando's is definitely a must wherever you are!
Took my wife and two kids here on Valentines day for a meal. There is a lot of variety to choose from I had a chicken curry and I must say it was really tasty and nice. We all enjoyed out meals and the price was pretty reasonable too. The only problem was ordering a second round of drinks as it took about 20 minutes and had to ask twice for them too. I appreciate the staff were busy but still 20 minutes for 4 drinks is a pretty long wait. I had eaten my starter and served my main in 20 minutes so that puts things into perspective. Overall the wait for the drinks does not overshadow the quality of the food which in my opinion was fantastic.
"The restaurant is comfortable and staff are courteous .The menu mainly caters for those who love meat. Not sure if there is a vegetarian option.The meal was pretty average , neither good or bad.Personally, I found it very expensive but obviously you expect to pay these prices in the West End.A long steep flight of stairs to the toilets is also something to be aware of.After paying a large bill it would have been nice to be thanked and wished goodnight upon departure"
"Dined on Monday, 15th Feb. Family celebration. Service awful, waitress had to check every request. Wrong meal brought out for child and another waitress insisted we must have ordered it...I think not! 241 cocktails were full of ice, watery and lacked any true flavour. A balloon and hat was the only acknowledgement to our 80year old dad's birthday, not even a rendition of happy birthday! Food itself was good but definitely won't return and will head back to Leicester Sq which is busier, better atmosphere and decent service."
"We breakfasted here for a week and it was perfect. The cappuccino was frothy with a drizzle of chocolate powder on the top; I had either a croissant or small muesli and my husband either porridge, yes, warm porridge is offered, or a bacon and egg roll. It is self-service, you pick out what you want from the display case and pay for it at the counter where you can order drinks. Eating in the Pret is a bit more expensive than take-out but then you can sit comfortably at clean tables and stay as long as you want. After a couple of days, the staff recognized us and already knew what we wanted to eat. That gives a good feeling. Pret is great for the whole day. The sandwiches are fresh so too are the salads and soups. ÏHandmade natural food is what is written on the paper serviettes in the Pret and that is exactly what you get."
"Called in for dinner before heading home after a day out in London.Efficient service, despite being very busy, and I used Tesco Clubcard points to pay for the food, so only had the drinks to pay for which made it very good value considering the location."
"We had lunch at Union Jacks in Covent Garden before we went to the theatre. The location was lovely in the heart of Covent Garden splendour. The restaurant was well set out and very warm with overhead heating and warm seats and feet. I guess it will be really useful when we get to the winter.There was a limited menu which apparently was due to the fact that they didnt have approval for an extract flue for the ovens and so couldnt offer any hot food at all. However we only wanted a snack and so ordered a Quiche with salad and a chicken salad, no cooking just plating up. The drinks can quickly, the food much slower. The quiche was dreadful, obviously no-one had tasted it as it was tasteless apart from the slab of unmelted cheese on top. The vegetables in the pie were watery and they had turned the egg part into a mush. The chicken salad was better but the pieces of chicken looked like they had been boiled and so was white and gristley. We left most of it. I think it was a case of style over substance. It all looks lovely and well presented but i wouldnt go there for the food at the moment. Hope it gets better."
"The building itself is worth going to see. Originally a Savoy Cinema, lots of memorabilia lines the walls. Otherwise what you would expect from a wetherspoons pub! Friendly and well priced."
"Party of 6 visited Saturday lunchtime. Seated quickly but waited a short while before ordering drinks. Other than that the food was really tasty (especially the wings) and the service was good. One party member asked for no salad with their meal but when it Arrived it had salad, however before we mentioned it the waitress realised and brought a complimentary rack or ribs. All in all great value for money and would recommend."
"Visited the recently opened Byron hamburger in Milton Keynes, the centre MK. Staff very attentive. Found the meals to be nothing special for the considerable cost. First, the price shown is just for the burger. Add on a small bowl of chips extra £3-25. Classic burger, £6-75 so burger and chips £10 add a soft drink your looking at £13. There is a minute bowl of salad with the ""skinny"" burger ( no bun) this consisted of 2 slices of cucumber and 2 quarters of tomato laying on a bed of salad leaves. Really can't see who they are aiming at. A family of 4 roughly £45- £50. There is a Burger King and Macdonalds in the centre. Students, young people? I can't see them paying £13 for a burger plus £4-50 for a can of beer. Both people I was with said the Burger was nothing special with no appreciable taste to set it apart from any other burger chain. Prices might be OK in central London etc but in fairness despite the staffs best efforts you could see why this place was virtually empty. Overall very disappointing."
"We popped in for a quick drink as we were early for our matinee performance at the Albert Hall.The bar man was very professional and served us promptly. He even found me a phone charger as I had run out of battery.The decor is quite austere and smacks of somewhere you might go if you don't want to be seen.One downside is that there was a family in there with very noisy children who were being allowed to run around (I know that this isn't the fault of the bar but still....). I have children myself but at nearly £10 for a glass of fairly standard white wine, I do expect to be able to drink it in peace!"
"We went here as an organised event. Many people don't eat meat or prefer to restrict their meat intake these days, but there ewas very little on offer for us and I ended up having a plate of vegetables."
"My girlfriend and I ate here on a Sunday evening and loved the meal and surroundings.The service all round was excellent with both courses being thoroughly enjoyed. I started with a diveine soup (leek, cauliflower & potato) and my girlfriend with the pate and both dishes were fantastic.I had lamb for main and my partner had the half roast chicken with wild mushroom sauce. Again the dishes were well sized and tasted great.Washed down with a great bottle of champagne we thoroughly enjoyed our visit."
"Fourth visit today - this time 4 adults (1 needing gluten free food) and 2 children. I checked they had GF food and we were handed a GF Menu and childrens' menus when we were seated. The waitress sat at the childrens' (6 and 4) level to ask the children what they would like and also made sure that she checked with Mum before wring the order down. The GF menu was extensive enough and and the food was, as always very good. More visitors coming next month -we will be back!!"
"This is a great little find just off Brixton hill, amazing coffee, friendly staff. Food looked good but I didn't eat. Worth checking out"
"This is the second time we have been and we were just as impressed. The food is incredibly tasty - particularly recommend the firecracker vegetables which are presented to you on fire and they taste incredible. They haven't got a particularly good wine list - but it is cheap and reasonably drinkable (the wine starts at around £12 a bottle). The meal is very reasonably priced too. My only criticism is that the service is a bit slow, and they have a habit of being food out at different times, e.g. One main came out 5 mins before the other main. But overall I'd highly recommend this place as a nice local restaurant."
"Situated across a bridge from the Stsbles, Dingwells and Market this big fronted pub draws the weary market travellers. Area outside to sit on good days to watch the boats and people of which there are enough of them to keep you occupied.Big space showing the sports and tables for food. Typical weatherspoons so you know what you are getting. Prices big variation to Northern weatherspoons or it appeared that way.For a relax after being walked around the rabbit warrens of the markets and stables it was a welcome rest. In the warmer weather it will be rammed. Join the the throngs"
"We foundPret on happy accident while just walking looking for pace to eat, Pret has counter service only but lots of options. The entire place is handicapped accessible. The coffee is the true star of the show. It is excellent. Good pastry. I opted for a breakfast yoghurt. Called rabbit it was like Waldorf salad with yoghurt.Pret is very green and donates food to organizations we feed folks..When you happen on a Pret do stop in.."
"The menu was beautiful, and the menu sounded delicious wish they had more details about the menu thou . The chicken I had wasn't really marinated lacked seasoning. Drinks had more ice then the actually fluid."
"Great, traditional pub near elephant and castle and a short walk to the Imperial war museum, wide selection of food and drink and very friendly staff."
"I have given it 2 stars as anything with melted cheese gets 2 stars. Having been served thick gooey toasted cheese in the US, and seeing the pics on Facebook I couldn't wait. Ate in and got a classic with fries and a Coke. Sandwich Arrived quickly in a bag. Strange. Fried 5 mins later with extra cheese that wasn't ordered. Underwhelming sandwich - looked like a panini rather than one done on a flat top grill. Cheese not exactly generous and nothing like their pictures. Fries very McDonalds. No obvious sauces. What seemed a great idea was reduced to just another Soho sandwich bar. They offer 6 different varieties, but why bother when you can't even get plain right. It was cheap, but I'd pay more for less!"
"Well, a five star review for a chain-restaurant seems strange, but this is well warranted. I visited Busaba for a family meal and was left speechless. The food here was diveine, the calamari was world class, the chilli beef astounding and the tender stem broccoli was as crisp and clean as a brand new shirt! Superb food. Service was good, a little mix up with the food however which was soon rectified. A big thumbs up from me, I will be back!"
"English food has gotten a bad rap for years (some of it deserved) but it's a new era. Many traditional English delights served at Rules, with care and skill in the selection of ingredients and the cooking. Game comes from priveate estates - if you've never had grouse, it's wonderfully prepared here. Oysters always taste as though they have just been plucked off briny rocks. Fish is fresh and vegetables are tasty. If you've always wanted to try steak & kidney pudding, this is the place. The Stilton at the end of the meal is fabulous. Wine list is admirable, with affordable choices also & good wines by the glass. Service is subdued but very attentive. Charming old prints and paintings line the walls. Rules has been there forever - ive been going since I was a child & it has only gotten better. I always make it a point to dine here when I'm in London. It always seems to be open & is perfect for a pre or post theatre meal."
Staff is extremely friendly and the restaurant has a nice atmosphere. The quality of the food was a bit disappointing though and we were not given much time between the courses so it all felt a bit rushed. Location is very convenient for theatre visits. It is best to book your table in advance if you want to have dinner between 6-7.30pm.
"We ate here for my Husbands birthday on a Saturday night. The restaurant was busy and we knew about the no booking policy so when asked if we would like to wait in the bar downstairs we were quite happy to. The staff were welcoming and friendly and although the bar downstairs is small, having visited bars of this nature in Venice, it was atmospheric and a good Aperol Spritz was made by the barman. A member of staff came downstairs to fetch us about 15 minutes later and were taken to a table back upstairs. The menu was explained to us and we chose a variety of dishes all of which were lovely, fresh and plentiful - it's surprising how full you can get with 'small plates'! The atmosphere in the restaurant was buzzy and cosy which we enjoyed. Overall we had a great time, will certainly return and can recommend."
"Great spot to stop off for a drink. Off the beaten path, but not by much. A fun spot, especially for the younger crowd."
"We stopped here for lunch several times during our stay in London. Love that the food is made fresh daily from good ingredients, and their selection is always pretty good. Reasonably priced too."
"This place is great, restaurant is a bit cold and lacks atmosphere but is clean. The food is amazing, service is polite and fast. Much better than then big chains nearby."
"We found out about this place from HyperJapan about a year ago and visited this restaurant a few months back. The food then was much nicer, food was simple, specialised only in ramen, had great flavour and the restaurant was spotless. Not sure what happened as there are some familiar waiters, but there must have been a complete turnaround in the kitchen.. We ordered a couple of ramens and a gyoza; and were truly disappointed :( noodles were overcooked (lost that al dente), eggs over boiled, charsiu really fatty, soup was too greasy and loaded with caramelised onions which isn't typically in a Japanese ramen. The Indian waiter sat a couple next too us and saw the table wasn't cleaned (soup spilled by the previous guests) and just dapped a serviette and he wasn't too bothered about cleaning the table.. It'll be great to have the old team back as they were a fantastic little restaurant back then..."
Waggamummas IN HAMMERSMITH (please note Tripadviser readers this restaurant unfortunately does not have their own page as yet) has a lovely atmosphere and very friendly and helpful staff. We ate there prior to seeing Yusuf/Cat Stevens at the Apollo. The food was excellent. Fresh and piping hot. The wine was good too. Overall a lot nicer atmosphere than other Waggamummas we have visited.
"we were staying in victoria and looking for a fast, fresh meal. great variety on menu options."
"The place is too crowded and the service is terrible. We ordered from child menu, a plain pasta and chicken, waited around 40 minutes, the pasta was ice cold and hard as stone, the chicken too salty, they bring my husband's order but forget mine. I had been to another tgi places before, first time i saw such a terrible service and bad served food."
"My wife and I went here recently to celebrate our 11th anniversary. We were not disappointed. The food was amazing. we had excellent service from the waiter Faris,Look forward to coming back."
"A good place to go shopping, if you need to buy some specific brands or vegetarian food. I actually went to the Whole Foods on Kingsington Rd., and bought ingredients for cooking and from salad bar. The store was not totally vegetarian (and neither completely 100% organic) but it's possible to find a large variety of earth-friendly foods, natural skincare and homeopathy products."
"chicken, steak or chips! how wrong can you get. I was staying at the hotel next door so was just perfect dinner for me."
"Came in here for a quick stop whilist I was showig my friend round London. Saw it from the outside and it caught my attention. Went inside, ordered and the food was great! Tasty, big portions and proper japanese hospitality. Will be going back this weekend! IT IS VERY CHEAP TOO! Highly recommended"
I'm a great fan of Weatherspoons but for once this one was not up to scratch. The venue itself was well worth a visit. Well restored and full of nostalgia. Unfortunately the normally excellent breakfast was not up to normal standards. A lot of the ingredients were not particularly hot and seemed to have come from a warming shelf. Also the coffee service seemed to have problems in that it was being dispensed from behind the bar rather than being available from the self dispense urn on the bar. Would still recommend this chain to anyone seeking good value and often interesting venues.
A large shop just a short walk from Victoria Station. Diveided into a take away F&C on one side and restaurant adjacent. The restaurant is quite large and tastefully furnished and very clean. It is also air conditioned. An extensive menu and a daily specials board. I usually have the haddock and have always found it to be superb the restaurant is licensed and has a bar selling a wide selection of drinks. The staff are extremely welcoming and polite. Good toilet facilities.
"Went to the cocktail lounge upstairs, lounge being the appropriate word! Felt like we're were in someone's house, quickly little rooms with mishmash of furniture but really quaint - we loved it. Not at all pretentious and waiter was really knowledgeable and suggested great cocktails based on our preferred tipple!"
Amazing food and fantastic service. We left the food choice to our waiter and he surprised us with some amazing dishes.Loved every bit!
They used skimmed milk in my hot chocolate (in spite of the fact that I specifically asked for full fat milk) and it tasted awful. It was barely even lukewarm. For £3 it's outrageous!I'm hesitant to go to Pret anyway as they throw out all of their perfectly good food at the end of the day - the staff are NOT allowed to take it home or allowed to give it away. What a waste.
Very good fish 'n chips and a nice wine selection. The waiting staff were so friendly and chatty and made our visit all the more enjoyable!
"Popped in for a Mocha take-away. The girl on the till explained the chocolate was very rich and would we like extra milk? She let us try the chocolate before we purchased the drink, which was delicious. Excellent service and delicious Mocha!"
"8 of us visited The Park Terrace Restaurant at the Royal Garden Hotel on a Saturday shortly before Christmas having purchased a deal through Travelzoo which included a cocktail prior to the meal. In the past every cocktail I have had has always tasted like a soft drink - but not this one it was a Side car and had a real kick. This was just the start of a wonderful meal and a real experience - the food was absulutely superb and the care and service level given by all staff was second to none. You often find when going out with a group of 8 people that someone will be less than happy with some part of the meal. Not here - we have all eaten at excellent restaurants throughout the world and on cruise ships yet we all agreed that this was probably the best meal we have ever had ( and none of us are young!) Sometimes with a deal through Travelzoo or the like you are treated as second class customers, but cetainly we were made to feel very comfortable and as I have said received first class service. I wil be recommending this resaurant to all my friends."
"We Arrived on a Saturday to be faced with a waitress that said the kitchen is closed. It was only 4.30pm. We said ok and started to walk away. I turned around as we were walking and said, there was no notice on the site. She then said ÷oh, ok'.My partner said when is it opening again. She said ÷6pm'.I was worried about our experience as we travelled far and we were faced with this waitress that almost didn't want us to eat there from not mentioning the kitchen opening times.Maybe the restaurant owner Camilla Fayed doesn't realise people travel far and there is no mention of kitchen opening times on the website. it's a strange hour to close, isn't this losing out to prime business?Anyway, onward with the food;As a meat eater, I was surprised at how good the food was. It was tasty, filling, a little on the small side but otherwise nice. It a little higher priced that other places and the portion size makes you think you could get a little more elsewhere (i.e., you could almost count the chips on the plate which were under 10!) For meat eaters, you would want to go elsewhere which is a shame. For Veggies, it maybe extorts them with high prices. I wish we had more veggie restaurants around that were this good, but didn't charge so much. Maybe that's why veggie places go out of business and/or hard to come by?Our waiter was good and it redeemed the experience we initially had.Overall; nicely cooked food. Small portions, expensive for what you get but I didn't leave with a heavy stomach feeling. My meat eating ancestors would be shocked if they heard that_"
"Wow, what an amazing restaurant. Staff really friendly, professional and attentive, and love to help you find the right dish. The manager was also really friendly and helpful.The food was amazing and really tasty, especially the mixed grill.I would highly recommend it this restaurant and can't wait to go back"
We went here to eat after reading the Tripadvisor reviews. We were not disappointed. The food and service was excellent. We will definitely be back next time we are visiting London.
"after a couple of hours of walking, we (party of 5) were looking for a place to have late lunch. I read some of the mixed reviews and was a little bit hesitant to go for it, but the rest of the family convinced me.Clearly not a top restaurant - I didn't expected a top restaurant in this tourist area - but better than some of the mixed reports.We had Fish and Chips, Banger Pizza, Veggie Pizza, soup, salad and some beverages.The food was better than average and the price - for the area - was better than expected. our waiter was very friendly and great, but I got the feeling that some others were not so great. Again, we were lucky. I wouldn't go there for a big dinner, but for lunch it was pretty good."
"Our lunch here was a bit of a happy accident as its tucked away behind Warren St station! In the summer months they have a BÌÁnh mÌÂ stand set up for takeaway baguettes and that's what caught my attention.We decided to sit in and were pleasantly surprised by the industrial decor. The first thing you will notice is that they use the traditional pie and mash enamel bowls which is a really cool touch. The portions look HUGE and everyone seems to be eating something delicious, piled higher than high!We weren't very hungry and a little short on time so we ordered a range of appetisers! The real star of my own show were the summer rolls - the most delicious I have had since in Vietname itself! My partner loved the chicken wings! This is also the only place I have eaten in London where you pay for prawn crackers (the darker, yummier kind) and get a massive bowl rather than 4/5 measly crackers for £4.00I cant wait to go back soon so I can try the Pho as it looked amazing!!"
A pity that the location is not brilliant but once inside you can dismiss the exterior as the welcome is warm and friendly. Knowledgeable bar staff who will let you try before you buy and fantastic Scotch Eggs at reasonable prices for London make this abode a worthwhile stop.
"A restaurant with a lovely old school atmosphere,very good service from the moment we walked in to when we left,found the food to be very nice,I had the Cornish cod and the wife had the pork tenderloin for mains and apple and rhubarb crumble and lemon meringue ,finished the night off with a drinks in the lounge upstairs,will go back for sure"
"We acted upon our hotel's recommendation - however - we made the mistake of not making reservation - fortunately the very friendly and efficient staff found a table in this very busy restaurant.We ordered white bait as a starter - unfortunately - different countries and cultures provide different expectations. The white bait presented was like nothing else we have experienced in our travels - dry - covered in breadcrumbs - disappointing.I ordered the whole grilled bass with a side of spinach - well cooked and presented, however, my wife ordered Atlantic salmon (without reading the fine print on the menu) and was presented with a fillet of beautiful salmon covered in batter - disappointing to say the least- dreadful way to treat a beautiful piece of fish.Subjective test - would we return or recommend = no !"
Very busy but great buzz and friendly and quick service . Almost everyone going for the theatre but staff is trained to deal with the rush .
"I visited this Cafe along with my family as we are Apprentice fans. Upon walking in, the staff asked if we were ""Apprentice fans"" and made us feel very welcome. They were very pleased to talk about their experience of this venue being part of the show etc.The breakfast was really nice and the tea nice and strong. It is a proper no frills cafe and whilst it does look a bit like the inside of a prison cell, at the end of the day; it is what it is.I wish I lived locally to here as I would use it regularly. Hope one day to return again."
"Always a great outing for family and friends to enjoy a relaxed and smart evening out with great food served by attentive staff. Different rooms offer a change of ambience at every turn. Not a cheap venue, but does feel like a special night out."
"I visited here last weekend for brunch with my friends. The food was ok - I had hash brown with poached eggs. However the bread from the bread station was not up to par. The soda bread was so hard I could not cut it. Also for the expense I would expect them to bring us a basket of bread to our table instead of us having to go to the station and toast it our self whilst our food goes cold.Also, the attitude of the head waiter was abysmal. I really wish I had got his name. The rest of the staff was lovely but he had an arrogant and mocking tone which none of our party appreciated."
"Arrived at 5.30pm on a Thursday - plenty of table choice and we sat far away from the door, near the bar. The waitress was charming, witty, encouraging and attentive. We felt welcome and taken care of. Dough balls made for a good solid started whilst we relaxed, drank and chose our mains - pizza & two burgers with fries. They were delicious and hit the spot. Desserts of waffle with ice-cream and cheesecake topped off things nicely."
"Had to wait for barman to complete long drinks order before our presence was acknowledged. We received a friendly greeting at last but had to find our own table. Waitress just about went through the motions; miserable, monosyllabic and completely disinterested. No apology for spilt drink or dirty cutlery. Warned about 30 minute delay for food but it took longer; not sure why as it wasn't over busy. Food OK but nothing special. Had no intention of leaving a tip but 10% service charge added to bill. We would not have paid this but our host did not wish to have a debate about it. We were thanked by barman on leaving but his friendliness needs to be emulated by the servers."
Went recently for Sunday lunch with the family. it was busy with diners and the place has a real buzz. Good range of beers available and the service was good despite how busy they were.We all opted for the roasts and all thoroughly enjoyed the food.I had the Dexter beef which for me was perfectly cooked just under medium rare. All in all a good place with a great atmosphere.
"Having stumbled across this restaurant when looking for a new Japanese restaurant I was pleasantly surprised to see the positive reviews it had received. Upon arriveal you will notice this doesn't have the appearance of a high end restaurant; however, the food is sumptuous and you'd do well not to wander on by.I have found previously that in some restaurants where the host doesn't speak English fluently that you cannot ask about the menu in the depth you would like or ask questions about the business. As the host at Jin Sushi was English conversation and questions were easily facilitated which is a nice point when you may be unfamiliar with the cuisine. The food itself was very good, and I'd say that the sushi had a freshness to it without being bland, and nice balance of flavour that you don't always get. My partner and I had chicken gyoza, fried squid, seaweed salad, a selection of inside-out rolls, a BBQ eel hand roll, and some black cod and some tempura prawn. The positives I would say were the lightly battered squid that was so light and melt in the mouth. The inside-out rolls were some of the best ive had and the black cod was cooked perfectly. The only negative was that as with most Japanese food you are left with wanting more, especially considering the Black Cod is a relatively small portion (the same everywhere I have been to be fair).In terms of value the meal came to £52 which considering what we had eaten was very good and the Black Cod was £15.50 alone. That said the sushi itself was very reasonably priced and if you wanted just sushi and starter dishes I think the value would go into the very reasonable bracket. As with this type of cuisine, you get what you pay for and if you want to eat expensive fish you have to pay, but there were plenty of cheaper ones available. The restaurant is quite small so it may be advisable to book in advance as I imagine it can fill pretty quick and they also offer take away from what I could pick up from the chatter. I can say without reservation that I'll pop back here and tell some friends about this venue. Next I'd like to see a buffet menu as this would really bring in the crowds and compete with some other Japanese restaurants in the area."
"I went here on a Sunday afternoon for a bit to eat. The choice of ales and wines was excellent but it was a real mixed review on the food. The majority of us had burgers but one came with an added deep-fried insect with the chips. This was taken away but we weren't offered anything else or a discount from the bill. Another had the beef pie but found it more gristle than meat. I had the haddock and chips, which was lovely. A really light batter and just the right size. However, as this is London, all over-priced. I'd come here again for drinks but probably not food."
"My husband and I went for lunch after reading all the reviews from other travelers with TripAdvisor. We ordered the 2 course lunch each and everything was amazing, especially the lamb kabobs and the baklava!! Highly recommend!"
"My husband and I went to Frankies on a deal and thought we would only get a small selection of the menu - this was incorrect - the whole menu was on offer.Both the service and food were of excellent quality. So much so, we are taking our friends to Frankies for belated birthdays."
Another enjoyable meal in the buzzy atmosphere of Hardy's. Our party had delicious starters of soup and scallops. Followed by fish & chips and chicken with crumble and ice xream for dessert. The food is always very nice but the chicken whilst tasty was a bit overcooked and the service a bit slow as they were so busy on a Friday night hence the 4 stars not 5 in my review. A v nice local brasserie and reasonably good value for money.
"Went here for lunch. I had some delicious French sausages and lentils, a glass of wine, chocolate mousse and coffee, all for less than £20 including service. The staff were great and it was a pleasant atmosphere. Difficult to beat for value."
Our meal was the most authentically homemade meal we have ever had not at home! This place is definitely 'no frills' but the friendly staff and great food make it worth a visit. Appreciated the fact that when we called to book Tom told us to bring our own wine as paying corkage of £2.50 would be better than the wine on offer in house!
Excellent view from the highest lounge in London. The price of the drinks and food was really reasonable for a chic place like this.
In southend for a day out and chose bella pasta as our evening meal. Had a 2 course meal for £9.99 which was a mini lasagne as a starter followed by macaroni cheese. All of it was luscious and really plentiful. We were stuffed!
"Along with Wiltons, probably the best restaurants for British food in London. Sadly game was not in season, but there are plenty of other items on the menu to delight. And unlike Wiltons, its nice to take a walk around the neighbourhood afterwards."
"Me and my husband loved this place. Such a nice atmosphere with the kindest, most welcoming people working there.The food was absolutely fantastic, and our waiter, Guillermo, was so nice. On top of that the prices were really not bad!I have nothing negative at all to say about this place, and we will definitly come back here the next time we're in London."
"If you want to experience some of the best fish and chips in the London area, you MUST visit this restaurant! From the variety of fish to choose to make your particular fish and chips dish to the homemade chips --- bottomless, you get as many as you can eat with your dinner --- this was a true highlight for a London experience. The staff is attentive and the atmosphere is delightful. The restaurant is always busy and usually full. Reservations are suggested to make sure you have a spot! Dinner was fabulous and definitely tasty!"
Have been to Manjal twice now. Always delivers delicious meals. Had lamb kottu roti and masala dosa last time we visited and it was delightful. Great wait staff! Will definitely be back to try out a few more dishes in a few weeks.
"I had heard via friends about this place and despite liveing local for many years had never tried it out. We visited for a Sunday roast with friends and Tom sums up all you expect plus more from Irish hospitality... Great banter, extras chucked in with no additional cost and empty plates all around. The ham roast was something else and I recommend saving room for the bakewell tart, already booked to take the Mrs back within the fortnight!"
We enjoyed a absolutely lovely meal this week before we went to a show at the Royal Albert Hall. Food was delicious service was great and excellent value for money. We will definately be back
We dropped by Byron's for lunch and had a good meal. The burger is large so pace yourself. The fries were delicious and the beer was a perfect blend. The staff were great. Lots of people there for lunch - a good sign if the locals are there.
Service was quite rude. A waitress taking away a half drank cocktail without asking. When I went up and asked for a refund they refused and were overall quite rude and not apologetic for ruining my overly expensive cocktail.
"Visited on a busy Saturday night for a friends birthday.Drinks were tasty and good value, however the toilets leave A LOT to be desired. I'd recommend avoiding them if possible!"
"Food was overall very good, but the best was the side dish of broccoli with bread crumbs and garlic! The restaurant set in the middle of Covent Garden is quite pleasant, service for us was quick and there was always a member of staff easily accessible when we needed something, which doesn't seem to be the norm in London. All our dishes were nice sized and perfectly cooked (salmon, lamb, steak). The place was moderately busy so quite comfortable but might be a bit claustrophobic when it fills up with tables so close together."
"I don't usually consider a 'chain' fast food outlet suitable for comment, but I make an exception with Pret because it is consistently good and, arguably, that little bit better in terms of the quality of its product, than it actually needs to be, and that is refreshing!We find that we can always rely on Pret and, for that reason, find ourselves returning to their outlets time and again."
Love yo sushi!! Main chef was great very helpful and fun. Love that you can order food if you prefer it fresh and not what is going around. Good value for money and resonanlr
We came here for our wedding anniversary and would thoroughly recommend. The staff were very helpful and attentive; the food was excellent. We shared an ice-cream dessert as the portions are very generous.
"This was probably the worst meal I have eaten in a long time. And by eaten I would say I had 5 forkfuls before I stopped. We had been planning on coming here after walking past a number of times and thinking how quaint it appeared. I ordered risotto, my husband had the rigatoni and we shared some garlic bread. It was terrible. My husband tried to finish mine so as to save embarrassment but couldn't (and he is not very particular). Even the garlic bread was bad - stale and tasteless. The risotto tasted like a tomato flavour cup-a-soup, the gorgonzola rigatoni like cream. The sparkling water was nice and the decor was fun. We will never go back."
"After a long flight from the states, we found our way to Zia Teresa, an establishment close to our home rental. We were so pleased by our host seating us quickly despite not having a reservation. It was very very busy with a lively crowd. We were seated in the basement which was well situated. We ordered 2 pizzas, calamari, and a spinach ravioli. All dishes were adequate and brought to us quickly.. prices were high, but this is likely a reflection of the neighborhood. They were kind to accommodate my children's drink requests. Overall, a nice meal for weary travelers."
"Book ahead, this is a popular restaurant in a very busy street. Gorgeous interior decor, friendly staff. Rabbit offer a british take on tapas and it works! Their bloody mary's are worth a visit alone (they use horseradish) Eat here."
Not nearly as good as Jamie's italianGood quality not great and certainly hadn't spent much on the fit outWouldn't go back as really no experience just a transaction
We like The Princess and its in a great location but the food and drink bit over priced - its great for a business lunch and someone else is paying!
Slow service but we had time so that was OK. Good meal deal of 2 and/or 3 courses. We all had a selection of the deal course and one person the nicoise salad. All enjoyed expect that grilled chicken was a bit overdone and a little bland.
"First time here lovely old theatre turned into a Wetherspoons. Ignored and place in queue taken without barstaff saying so when finally served I was served by a stroppy barmaid with a nose ring that asked me to show the beer I wanted when jokingly asking if it was her first day she snapped ""no!"" When I tried to lighten her miserable attitude she said "" don't try to make me feel any better it's not working"" the girl is in the wrong place of employment and wetherpoons needs to retrain their staff to respect customers just because it's cheap doesn't give the green light to speak to people like dirt. But the venue itself is great just needs a ironing out on the matters addressed."
Food was average but the service was TERRIBLE! They even tried to charge us 90 pounds more and didn't apologise for the mistake when we pointed it out...the only good thing about this place was the Xmas decorations at Covent Garden.
"Yesterday was my first and last visit to TGIs. We ordered the Cajun chicken nachos to start which were covered in so much onion under the cheese. These I could just about bare. But my main, I went for the veggie quesadillas. With vegetables. They were stuffed with red onion, massive bits of white onion and pepper. Do not get how they can class this as vegetables! The rice tasted like cheap savoury rice which you can get out of a packet as well. I definitely won't be going back there again. The food was disgustingly bland. I love onion but this was on a different level. Definitely not worth the money! I only are a mouthful of my rice and picked out all of the onions in my quesadillas! Never will I be returning to TGIs again. Disappointed."
"Went in this Sunday for a roast to find the place extremely busy, was found a table quickly by a lovely young lady who took our drink order. We then ordered our food and received it within 10 mins, I had the beef and my partner had the nut roast which looked so goo I had to try and wasn't disappointed, the beef was cooked beautiffully and the potatoes were lovely. Service was great and food was great would definitely go back."
"We had gone to Belushi's for happy hour were the large cocktails are only £10. The music was great one downside would be the lack of choice when it came to the cocktails, though the cocktails were very good and would recommend this place."
I came here as I had read the reviews on some gluten free website and really enjoyed my visit. We had a drink in the bar first which I thought was lively and buzzing. Lovely to see that well behaved dogs were allowed in the bar ( though didn't have mine with me ).We ate on the top floor which was light and airy. The menu was clear showing exactly what I could and couldn't eat and the staff very knowledgable. Such a relief to feel like a customer. The service was exactly the right balance and in the end couldn't believe that we had been there for 4 hours without be hurried on at all. I would definitely come back.
We came on a busy weekday evening and it was full of young professional types having dinner and drinks. We sat at the bar and got great service from the bartender and ordered a selection of very tasty tapas style dishes. The food was good and the atmosphere was energising.
"Wonderful food, drink and service for a vegan, veggie and two omniveores. Make sure you tip in cash and NOT on the card. The mean management I'm told only give 1% of the tip on the card to staff. ALWAYS tip cash as the great staff deserve it. Great relaxed meal. Best recommendation is that I will return. Well worth going"
We were searching arounf the city centre when we finnaly found this Prezzo restourant. We had an amazing the new year eve dinner here and we loved it!!! Although it seemed like every waiter is italian and speak english with some problems. But the food is perfect!!
"Was here a week past Monday and ordered the chicken burger n fries which was very filling indeed . As the place was so busy I had to sit at the bar but was a good laugh and staff very friendly. Would recommend if very hungry s large portions , the beer was good also"
"Im disgusted by the staff at this restaurant! I cannot believe the lack of care they had. Food was un eatable. they gave us a discount in hope that we would think that it was a good experience, but it was absolutely disgusting! Im very disappointed with the quality of the food , rude staff and overpriced meals. Definitely don't recommend to anyone!"
"We were greater by an amazing doorman that was polite, courteous and had a great sense of humour. Was taken to the bar for a drink before dinner. The cocktail menu was brilliant and the choice of back shelf spirits was good too. A good bar for me serves a great gin and tonic with botanicals and grapefruit. After a couple of G&T's we were led through for dinner. We had 6 in our party and although the resteraunt was quite there was problems with the food. I had Lamb, very very fatty. The steak for my Wife was overcooked so was sent back. My sister had a salad, not too much can go wrong you would have thought..... the lettuce was wilted, chicken was just cooked and the I could have made a better dressing at home. All in all this was one of the worst meals I have had in a long while. It was such a shame as all I had wanted was for the family to have a lovely meal for my mothers birthday. The reason for 2 stars instead of one is the staff and the bar."
"I was looking for a really good British restaurant to take my Austrian in-laws to and spent quite some time researching to find Rules.I was not disappointed. The small upstairs bar, which I suggest going to before hand, was like stepping back in time to the 1950's or visiting an historic national trust property. The pint of ale I ordered was served in a silver tanker which was a great! The restaurant too was very traditional and old as you'd expect from a 215 yr old restaurant and very un-swanky. The food is sourced from the restaurants own estate and we found all the game dishes were all of great quality. Overall I was very satisfied. If I had to nit pick I would say that the dishes served were not as inventive as other restaurants in this price bracket - although it's food was very good. A superb choice for taking foreign guests out to or for taking a step back in time at a more unique restaurant. However in this price bracket there is quite some competition and without the unique atmosphere and decor I would not have ranked it quite so highly. A superb restaurant though!"
"Restaurant is small and homely Service extremely slow, there were 8 of us and it took over 20 mins for the waitress to finally take our order. We had various starters, big portions food very average and the garlic bread finally Arrived burnt and tasteless. Our main courses were slow too, some of the meals were not what we ordered! My daughter is a vegatarian and she specially said her she didn't want any fish/meat in her meal it was a veggie pasta. The meal Arrived with bits of chicken and bacon in! My bolognaise had no flavour either. The meal was pretty mediocre and when we complained about odd things like the veggie meal and requesting spoons for the pasta the waitress was quite abrupt. Not a place I would rush back too. I was upset as I booked this restaurant as it was my Mum's birthday and I wanted it to be special and special it wasn't. We shall not be returning."
"There are some phenomenal items on the menu and they tend to be the basics. The Groucho burger is stellar, the shepherd's pie delicious, and the salads solid. The variables tend to be the new items on the menu. They are hit or miss. The bar menu tends to be the best and is served in the dining room if you ask for it. If you are dining with friends, it's all about the atmosphere and the food tends to be quite good for great conversation!"
Last time the people i took who had Toms chicken and ham pie claimed it was the BEST pie they had ever eaten . so today for the first time indulged in said pie awesome great flavours full of big chunks of meat lovely potatoes plenty of veg and proper gravey MUST BOOK AS HAS TURN A CONSTANT FLOW OF PEOPLE AWAY very busy but always under control GREAT
"I live in the area and this wonderful lady is always opened late. I go in to buy soda when tesco is closed. I tried her food a few times and most times it has been Inedible. The fritters or bakes, dripping with oil, other times my fritters were so stale they stank of fridge and could not even soften, even after being put in the microwave. Its a shame because this lady is so friendly and lovely. Her food just isn't up to scratch"
"The table was so cool with all its features. The food was good to excellent. The decor modern. The only thing that brought it down was that when we Arrived our table wasn't ready (even though we had pre booked) and they sent us down to the bar for drinks. When we went down there was only a guy making sushi there and no one to serve us...we were not impressed. Had to wait approximately 15 minutes to be served a drink, which we didn't really want in the first place."
"A group of nine of us just visited for a friends birthday and overall people were very happy, but I'm afraid to say it's not my cup of tea.The restaurant is tiny, perhaps no more than 25 covers at any one time. The layout is tasteful and minimalistic, the staff attentive and knowledgeable. No doubt very pleasant. For cynics like me it felt a little contrived and a little pretentious, but that was me reading into things, it was not overbearingly so.The food was fresh, originally and exceptionally well presented. The beef was melt in the mouth yummy, but there was very little of it. The sushi was apparently good quality - I hate Sushi and went mainly for the beef but my friends and wife loved it.I learnt my life lesson when I was younger at The Fat Duck, I don't have a very 'refined' palate and I want to eat lots of yummy food. ""I'm impressed by the Bacon icecream Heston but I'd quite like a bowl of it, not half a teaspoon"". I don't want 9 courses of barely a mouthful, I want a few plates or one plate of tasty grub. Anyway, last night I knowingly made the same mistake to celebrate a friend's birthday. Engawa is exactly that, wow on presentation, lots of tiny mouthfuls. The sushi and sushimi were relatively generous plates, but sadly I disliked the majority of both. The beef was good, but less than 100gram in total - even the main steak was only two mouthfuls (although cut into 8 or 10 tiny pieces to create the illusion of more).On this occasion I do not want to give a bad opinion of this restaurant, it is what it is and I knew what I was getting myself in for. I went to a Sushi restaurant knowing I hate Sushi for goodness sake. This review is for people like me with a love of fine dining but a healthy degree of cynicism - avoid Engawa unless you adore Japanese food and want to pay over the odds for it. The beef is tasty, but essentially the same texture as tofu but tasting of cow. Don't go just for the beef, you will be disappointed! For nine of us the bill was £1150, with minimal added extras. The mind boggles at how many better ways there are to spend that kind of money."
"Was looking forward to going here with hubby on a weekend away in London. The service was great until a large table was seated, only 2 waiting staff & 1 barmaid.They didn't have 1 of the starters & only half of another!! There was no roast rib eye for Sunday dinner BUT there was rib eye steak. I ordered that thinking how worse could it get...... How wrong I was! The steak came & it was fatty and very salty. The peppercorn sauce was DISGUSTING!!! It looked more like a shop bought powder gravy with peppercorns at the bottom! As for desert, I was that disappointed & not a great choice on the menu that myself & hubby left. My hubby's starter of pigeon breast & main of beer battered cod was lovely. It has a great location and could be so much better. Only good point was the view from the boat!"
"Great pizzas, good family vibe and an awesome place! I would pay a fees to become a member, if they made it a club. Just an amazing place! Adds a great feel to the area."
"ive been to this restaurant many times. It is cheap and the food is good. The restaurant is small so it can get a bot too hot in summer and the fan is annoying. However, the food is good, the staff is nice and the price is more than honest."
"Went to the TGI fridays in Covent Garden last night, and was very dissapointed. The service was terrrible...we ordered drinks and had to remind them about the order 20 mins later. Our waitress was very abrupt and not friendly at all, and the food (apart from the jack daniels king prawn started) was very average. The waitress also tried to charge us twice for the meal, when the meal was split between 2 different cards, as she didn't check the ammount to be taken...luckily we did !!! Having been to a number of other TGIs, this one is well below par, with bad service, average food, and not a great atmosphere. yes they were busy, but every other TGI's ive been to has been busy..if not busier and the service has been great, so no excuses !!!"
We returned to Ormer after a delightful first visit to be wonderfully welcomed once again by their smiling and charming staff. The food was fantastic. Between us we tried most of the menu with the lobster ravioli as a starter and the turbot being stand out dishes. We were on our exit approached by the highly talented Shaun Rankin who has turned this restaurant into a real Mayfair masterpiece. Highly recommend and will definitely be returning.
Quick service. In less than 10 minutes we had our food on the table. Big bowls of delicious steamy ramen. Have in mind that this is a cash only restaurant
"Cozy place, lovely friendly people, great food in generous portions at good value. A real treat, either for quick snack, breakfast or a meal."
"We weren't sure about trying this restaurant - but glad we did! The steak was really tender - and was nicely cooked and presented. Service was prompt, friendly and efficient. We ate dinner here - and got there at 5.30pm. We left about 6.30pm and there was a long queue waiting outside for tables to become available. I don't think they take bookings. Excellent value - the steak/side salad was £10 excluding service. Chips were an extra couple of quid - but were lovely (cooked in dripping!) Small beer was £4.50 excluding service. All in all, a lovely meal and good value."
"It was our first experience We have been there with family.We tried garlic bread,formations And burachetta as starter.Reall nice.I ordered pizza margarita And my sister ordered penne arabiata.We both liked.Sevice was reasonable And quiet efficent.Thanks to them.I recommend this place"
"Disappointing start, as 7.30 table booking which we were still sitting in bar at 7.55 waiting for table, once sat food and service 1st class"
Used this pub when we were stopping in the Travelodge opposite. Decent size with loads of tables. Nice range of beers and very good pub grub at non rip off prices.
"We visited Megan's for a leisurely Sunday morning breakfast. On a cold morning we sat in the bustling, canopied, courtyard. Well lit and warmed by heaters. One of our party has many, serious, allergies and intolerances. The staff, particularly the (Australian?) lady who was the duty manager could not have been more accommodating. They are obviously well versed in these matters and noted all requests and suggested tempting alternatives to the menu options. One of these was poached eggs, on a sweet potato mash, with smoked salmon and avocado. Beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. Pronounced by my wife as probably the nicest breakfast dishe she'd ever been served. And certainly the most imaginative.The more ""conventional"" breakfast were equally as good. All told, a terrific experience in every aspect"
"Went 30 years ago for special family event and was so impressed we promised we would return.Duly did this for another special occasion with my wife and we were really looking forward to the evening.First of all you have to book at least a week in advance otherwise you can only get a table to eat at 10.00pm! had heard about Rules for years and vowed that one day I would have dinner there. My wife and I are both avid carniveores and we enjoy traditional English cuisine. But what a let-down we were in for. Our reservations were for 7:30 on a Wednesday evening, We Arrived 25 minutes early and were ushered straight to the table - we had thought we wanted to go to the cocktail bar at the restaurant but they decided for us that we were not!The service was Ò to put it mildly Ò disorganized. It took at least 15 minutes for us to be presented with menus and have our water glasses filled. The menu had very poor range of starters unless you like oysters - not really a British starter I would have thought would have been on the menu!! Once we were eventually able to place our orders we asked for the pheasant which was on the menu as a shared dish. We were then told it was off as it was out of season! Why were we not told that when we were given the menu?? My wife - not being enamoured with the choice of starters decided not to have any and I chose the pumpkin and mushroom soup. The wait for the water & menus should have alerted us because we then waited at least half and hour for the soup. When it Arrived it was like warm. The waiter brought over the MaÌ¨tre D and he apologised and took the soup away, Another twenty minute wait before it came back. The soup was hot but not piping hot which I would have expected. However it was extremely tasty and I enjoyed it. Yes!! you guessed it a further wait of 45 minutes before the main course of duck Arrived. Yes! - getting the picture!! It was not hot but luke warm and half the vegetables were cold on the very small tureen that we were provided with at a very high price I must say! - however after all the wait I decided not to complain at that point. When we completed the main courses I was asked by the MaÌ¨tre D if all was ok - I pointed out that in fact the meal had only been warm but the wait meant that I just wanted to eat the food. I told him that it was not acceptable. No Apology! The sweets came and the treacle sponge was very very tasty I have to say. When the plates were being cleared the MaÌ¨tre D said that he had investigated why the food was not warm. Wait for it!!! The reason was ...... because I had sent the soup back they had taken the duck out of the oven to put the soup in and because of this the duck had gone cold! How could I have not known that when you send something back everything else served after that will obviously go cold as a result - silly me!! So the lesson for this restaurant is don't send food back or you are punished with cold food in your next course!!It is interesting that there is a comment from a fellow Trip Advisor contributor on October 14th which was one week later with virtually the same complaint. At least he received a reduction we never even got a full apology! Also a couple on the table next to us said they were sorry to see us treated the way we were however they had been regulars at Rules and it had definitely started to decline. It appears that this restaurant is so busy they do not care about customer satisfaction as they can obviously fill the tables anyway.A special evening ruined and also a special memory tarnished - how very very disappointing. Berware all diners!"
"We visited on a very miserable day on a rainy Saturday afternoon in October 2014, the restaurant was incredibly busy and we were greeted at the door by a friendly man, who advised us we were looking at a 25 minute wait but that we would have to wait outside as there was no space to wait inside. Finally after our wait we were seated, in the corner by the window. My partner had to sit the same side of the table as me as it was not possible to get into the other side due to other diners taking up a lot of space on the table next to ours.The food was really good, we both had cheese burgers and these were up to the standard that we have come to expect in GBK and other premium burger restaurants and cooked as we had requested. It also Arrived reasonably quickly considering how busy the restaurant was at this time but it was also fresh and hot. Both of us had sides; one portion of skinny fries which were hot and plentiful and a portion of regular chips which were also well received. I had the strawberry fizz which was full of flavour and good value as free refills are given.The only downside is that the layout of the restaurant is very very cramped, they have maximised every possible space, people were even being offered to share tables with other people in order to get seated quicker. I understand that this is not the fault of the restaurant but I really feel that if the restaurant is that popular that they should look at expanding their premises to allow them to accommodate more people, more comfortably as the current layout doesn't make for a relaxing atmosphere.Pricing is the same as in any other GBK restaurant that I have visited elsewhere in the country, so good value for London. It is around £8 for a standard burger, some of the more fancy burgers are more expensive but that is to be expected. Sides and drinks are also reasonably priced.I would recommend this restaurant as the food and service were great but don't go expecting a relaxed meal and you should be prepared to wait as I imagine at peak times the waiting times are even longer than we experienced."
"Visited following a matinee show.We had booked in advance, just as well as there was a queue forming outside.The 3 course pre theatre supper was excellent.The hake was delicious.Service was very good.Will definitely be visiting again."
"The night here was on of changing scenery, we had a drink in the well stocked bar down stairs, ate at the restaurant on the first floor and ended with drinks on the roof terrace, the food was great, fresh and well presented, the tandoori lamb fillet with spiced new potatoes and spinach was amazing, my mate had the whole beer battered whiting, it looked spectacular. worth a visit and worth every penny if you like a relaxed evening with 5 star service."
"Polpo has been a runaway success in London, with branches sprouting in all the best postcodes. The formula is small sharing dishes of Italian food - everything from fritto misto di mare to meatballs in tomato sauce - washed down by well-sourced and interesting Italian wines by glass or bottle. Food, drink, and - at our branch at least in Farringdon - service, was all extremely good; more than enough to assuage the arriveal of the bill (really? - those little dishes of stuff actually added up to that??). The only downside is its popularity - no bookings taken in the evenings, and by 7.30 on a weeknight the joint was rammed and rocking."
"First time in busaba eathai and everything was really good. We had a sit really fast, Paco take his time to recommend the food and explain everything perfectly, really nice guy and friendly , then the food was as he said, the drinks a bit late but the restaurant was quite busy for the team ( they needded more people ) , and everyone was really nice at all the moment."
I love this place and wished we had one in the suburbs of Chicago. The sandwiches are fresh and delicious and they use only the healthiest ingredients! And the Malt vinegar crisps (chips) are to die for. Highly recommend trying this out.
"Went here for lunch on recent trip prior to a matinee, and were pleased overall by the experience. Food was seafood oriented, and we enjoyed the service, tastes and value. Were seated promptly and served by pleasant waiter. Nice variety of items to select from, and while we did not try any wine from the list, it seemed to feature good variety and range. Had the soup of the day and a salad side and both were nice. My wife tried the chicken and a salad and enjoyed it was well. So nice spot for lunch if you are attending a show at any of the closely theaters, and certainly better a block or two in from the hustle-bustle of Charring Cross street eateries. Would recommend and would go again."
"I stumbled upon this deli and popped in as it was the only decent looking place open and my stomach was growling. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was absolutely lovely, the range of choices was really good and I liked the idea of having four different dishes together, getting to try a few things. The staff were all really friendly and helpful as well. I have eaten in a lot of restaurants and cafes around London and I must say the flavours and quality of the food here puts it at the top of the list and on a par (if not better than) some far pricier places! Hope to be able to go back one day."
Great service and choice. Went to TGI's on our first night in London and enjoyed it so much we returned on our last night with family.
We were a party of 6 for lunch. We all found the food disappointingly below par - it was lacklustre and not good or tasty enough. Bland inconsistent salads. Hot food served on very cold plates. Bellevue Road needs a good local Gastropub. Please can you get your act together?
"Bonus points to these blokes who are running this cool and fancy take on an Indian attuned restaurant. Well planned with entry bar table- chairs to appreciate the chefs theatre and also good for very casual meet. Being a critique here will not justify as i was in all praises for their boldness in executing it. I loved their story of venturing to India and returned back to open this. All cool. On a more serious note, we ordered half a dozen due to curiosity and though the idea was over all great but there was a bit of work needed on finer execution of food. But again, I may go to check out more. Good keeping."
We fond the toilets dirty! The staff was carrying the food to be served so close to their body that the rice from our bowl got stuck to the waitresses shirt! Carrying food on the tray to the customers table is highly recommended! The dimsums were meagre and no tasty!They didnt clear away the dirty dishes quickly enough!I think we will stick to Pin Pong!!..
"Probably not the best day to judge, however, main complaint was we went in with the express purpose of getting drink and sitting on one of the four empty bench seats outside. Purchased drink, got plastic glasses, fought to door only to be told by door stewards, no drink outside. Our wives were not happy as they now had to crush into a crowded bar. Bad management decision on the day."
"OMGbeautiful. Wholesome rather than the usual spartan ""clean eating"". Try the porridge at breakfast. You won't regret it!Helpful staff You can help yourself to cucumber water!"
"My husband and I had pre-theatre dinner here on a Friday evening, having booked a couple of days before. It was busy by about 5.30pm. We have eaten at another TGIs before, and found this one to be similarly slick and offering reliably good food at fairly reasonable prices (especially compared to other non-chain Americans in London). We had shrimp, ribs and chicken, all of which were delicious (and hot).We also had some cocktails - always delicious and a vast menu. The beer is also cold (not a quality to be underestimated). The only slight issue was that once it got busy the service got a little slower, but not too significantly so. The waitress was very pleasant and polite.Overall, definitely recommended - we will be eating here (and at their other restaurants) again."
"Ambience- Nice, beautiful restaurant with wines all around. You can sit outside looking the street or in a cozy environment inside.Service- very good and friendly . The waiters are very nice.Food- nice Italian food, and good wine options"
try the sultan grill. An excellent choice of food. Good service and easily located near to Victoria in Pimlico. The only downside is that the tables are very close together but then that is a problem in a lot of London venues.
I can't really say enough nice things about Canto Corvino and its staff. From the first enquiry email they were incredibly helpful. There were 12 of us and the ambience was beautiful and the pre selected menu we planned was diveine. I had completely forgotten that one of our girls was veggie and they whipped up a vegetarian pasta dish on the spot for her and she said it was one of the best veggie pastas she ever had. This is a great place for a special meal. The prices are worth the food you get and the staff were so attentive and was a prefect start to our night.
"I have been here many times, the very first time I run into George Lucas (Star Wars creator), who was seated in one corner eating his burger. This place was where everything started for this famous restaurant chain. This is a very small HRC compared to many others, food is good and usually it is very crowded, but definitively worth visiting. Service always good, price is getting too high."
"Happened upon this spot which my roommates while exploring the area a few months ago. 3 words: cheap, delicious, filling. Portion sizes are nice and the service is quick. ive been coming back ever since"
"Service was good not too intrusive.Food was fantastic quality of the steak wasVery very good... It was slightly over cooked compared to how we wanted (rare) but was an amazing steak, with meat of that quality it didn't matter. Will 100% be back..."
"If you are looking for a simple healthy lunch look no further.a grat selection of wraps,sandwiches and salads all made fresh on the day. These guys pride themselves on fast food thats fresh and reasonable priced. Eat in or take away -plus a large selection of fresh fruits, nuts, yogurt and hot drinks. Family friendly."
"Called the oldest restaurant in London....it is very traditional, both the food and atmosphere. Very comfortable...right in the middle of Covent Garden."
"Amazing food, everything from crab fish was amazing . Beef fry was absolutely delicious. Will definitely come again."
Wow! Who knew that ready-made sandwiches could be this good! And their coffee and pastries were wonderful. So happy we found this place and wish we had one here in Florida!!
"You kinda have to know where it is as it is hidden in a basement and you don't come across even a sign until you have found it, perhaps that is the allure?It is dark with ecclectic furniture, but that makes it fun, great waitress too. Served with a glass of water which is topped up, making it a very responsible drinking place.Great for pre dinner drinks the ambience just reflects the whole area."
"Had dinner with 10 friends here. The location is great and has brilliant views across the river to the London Eye, the Houses of Parliament and County Hall as well as all the river traffic.A warm welcome greeted us and we were shown to a seated area in the bar to wait for friends. The service was good and the food excellent and reasonably priced for London. Only downside was that some of the dishes ordered weren't available which was a shame.I will certainly visit again."
"I have frequented this restaurant for a number of years since it was recommended to me by a friend. As an avid eater of Italian cuisine, I must say that Demartino is the best dining experience I have had outside of Italy. The food is cooked to a consistently high standard, the portions are more than generous and the service is friendly relaxed yet highly professional - and all at excellent value. The atmosphere this all creates is warm, buzzy and welcoming. Would highly recommend."
"I have taken my parents, friends and occasional business contacts to Roast and all have found something they especially enjoyed. This restaurant is served by some very good chefs who showcase good servings of high quality beef, lamb etc with very fresh vegetables and bread. I have often found beef Wellington a bit too heavy but here it is always just right. The pork with 'easy on the teeth' crackling is very good too, though I think the herb mixture between the meat and the crackling is usually a bit too strong for me. Service is good, especially at reception and the chefs really do work hard to deliver perfectly cooked meats. The name says it all 'Roast'...ed to perfection."
"I lived in Vietnam for a while, and believe me, this isn't just as authentic as you can get, but delicious as can be. Lotus stem and chicken salad was delightful, as were the noodle dishes. Everything was packed with flavour, using fresh ingredients. Definitely would go again for this.Just a shame the service is so disorganised. The staff kept confusing which order was for which table, and this also meant tables were billed incorrectly, including mine. Check your bill!Definitely would go again for the food though."
"We loved Emmett and Alice's service today. So attentive and made our trip to London Fantastic. We will be back!! We had gorgeous food, excellent atmosphere and great service."
I was there few weeks ago and the food and the service are as bad as each other! I was sick all night after dinner. The staff is dismissive and unfriendly. Would never go back
"The food was good and a reasonable price. Service was a bit slow, but they were quite busy. Great location and very convenient for an after theater supper. Somewhat noisy, but we enjoyed the lively vibe of the restaurant. We were able to get a table easily."
"Went to the restaurant with a colleague who had purchased a Travelzoo coupon for £59. As in previous reviews the coupon entitled you to a predinner cocktail, starter, main course, dessert, cheese and biscuits, coffee and petit fours. I was sceptical that you would get what you paid for and that staff would try and push wine sales to make up for the reduced price of the meal. Every single course was delicious and the staff attentive but not overbearing. The trio of desserts was a personal favourite. A very pleasant experience that I would fully recommend."
"Drinks, the alcohol is a rip off. My Dad ordered a can of beer and it came out tiny for the price and it wasn't even a branded beer. Stick to water if you're visiting here i'd say! I had the Pork Burrito with the queso and tortilla chips (from the starters). The Burrito was very nice but i'd say ive had better Burritos at various Mexican fast food restaurants in London. I was also putting the queso cheese on the burrito as i was eating it, i think without me doing this it wouldn't of had enough flavour. Also the burrito was very messy to eat, it had a LOT of liquid leaking out of bottom of it.I did really like the queso and tortilla chips, but i am a big cheese fan.My Boyfriend had the diablo burger which he enjoyed. He also had cheese fries on the side, these however, were just average. The service was alright. The guy who served us did not seem to understand much English at times and struggled to answer some of my questions. He didn't seem very happy to be serving us either.I would probably re-visit here at some point. But would not have a burrito. Main thing that would bring me back for Lunch service would be the queso and tortilla chips. I'd like to try the breakfast menu."
"I remember when Pret first opened up and now many years later the old favourites are there and there are tons of new things to try. The food is excellent quality and to be honest, I think the people who work there are trained properly, care and are part of a great company--you can just tell."
"We popped into this restaurant a couple of hours before going to the theatre. We ordered the following :- Chablis (very good, but a little sharp) - Bruschetta (very good)- Mushroom starter (excellent)- Potato skins main course (good)- Half rack of Jack Daniels ribs (excellent)- Coffee (very poor)A repeat visit is on the cards when next we're back in this area, and the service of the staff was polite and enjoyable. The toilets were clean (not always expected in this part of town). However, not a perfect ten because of the following :- shabby and torn leather seating in the booth (-1)- dishwater coffee (-1)So, all in all, an 8 out of 10 - still good enough for me to enjoy a repeat visit in the future. Recommended - especially the ribs !!!!!"
"The great thing with Pizza Express is you know exactly what you're going to get. This branch is no exception....apart from the change of menu since my last visit. I used to love Rusticella and Fughi de Bosco, neither of which are on the menu these days :-( However, I did enjoy my Veneziana pizza which would have in the days of the old menu been my third choice. But it was good, nevertheless. For desert I had Caffe Reale, again because an old favourite had been bumped off the menu, however this was lovely.It was a busy Saturday night, however the staff were attentive and helpful - offering to take our picture rather than our attempting rather pitiful selfies. Would definitely visit this branch again."
"Wasabi is a good place to go if you are in a hurry - like on your way home from work or to pick up a quick filling snack because you skipped lunch. It has a mixture of cold salad-ywith Asian style cold sliced chicken or pork usually breaded - hot soups - fresh juices and then the hot foods I always get what is effectively chicken katsu with noodles in a sturdy bowl with lid, wooden chop sticks, fresh ginger in a packet and a delicious Asian style saucy gravy over it - yum yum on a cold day or curled up in front of the TV with a film. Reasonably price and fresh. Recommend!"
Really love this place. It's not easy to mix different types of Asian cuisines but I think Tootoomoo does it really well! Would recommend to anyone. Me and my girlfriend have Japanese and Indonesian background so great to have such eclectic menus.My only request would be that I would like to use the retail side more but don't have the things I need (I know this just a small section but no harm in asking!). It would be great if you could stock some good sambal (oelek) and ramen noodles to save me going to Chinatown
"The food was lovely, however we got our starters before our drinks, and then only one out of three wine glasses was given to us initially. We had to wait about five minutes for the other drinks to be brought to the table. The food Arrived and it was delicious! I eat a lot of Thai food and this was nothing to complain about. Although one of us was left without a side and there was no communication to let us know it would be coming shortly. Once we had eaten, we remained at the table, talking and enjoy our time in the restaurant. Instead of being offered more drinks, the bill was brought to us without request. A shame about the service because I would love to have the food again!!"
"This was my first time in whitechapel branch with my wife and kids.i didnt notice the changes on their new menu so our waiter explained it to me very nicely with a smile :) the food was lovely amazing.We've been served by ""Jahed"" who was freindly and made us feel comfortable although the place was busy and saw him doing other tables but he didn't forget to come and ask us about the food and drink. Definetly we will be back soon :)"
"This restaurant has been here for over 40 years & has a lovely feel to it when you walk in, old school with pristine white linen on the tsbles. The staff/manager are friendly but sadly our waitress wasn't very knowledgeable, service was slowwwwww & she was forgetful. Food was so so, nothing to write home about & pasta was overcooked."
"My husband and I visited here recently and had the best pizza EVER which was cooked in a special oven in full view. We started with a prawn and crab mouse which was good and then followed it with the Old Spot Pizza with slow braised Pork and it was excellent, we also had the grilled chicken indian style which was tasty and succulent. Although it was busy the staff were very friendly and efficient and the whole experience was great, can't wait to go back. We also had the English wine which we recommend."
"Popped in here on a late Sunday night and was very impressed with the decor, the service and surprisingly, the prices. Tried a mini board of three cocktails and they were all superb. Nice end to a great day out"
"Was just after a pint and some vegetarian food that was actually vegetarian, not a meat dish that came without the meat. These guys came through with a great ravioli starter and a samosa and lentil main. Had a couple of issues with getting drinks but we got them in the end and the food more than made up for it."
"My last meal before leaving for Cambodia. I chose Rules in Covent Garden as I wanted English cooking. The choice was limited but still difficult to choose. In the end I went for the roast lamb as I wasn't sure if lamb would be available in Siem Reap. Happy to report it was succulent, tasty and the portion just right. The vegetables were cooked to perfection. A word on service Ò perfect. The waiters seem to know in advance what was required without always being at the table. I look forward to my return."
Visited this restaurant on a Friday evening at 6.30pm and it was surprisingly quiet. As such we were immediately seated. The waiter was attentive and the food Arrived promptly. I had the ribs which were particularly impressive and filling. Overall a great time was had.
"Walking the area looking for somewhere to have some dinner after a local pint, I was happy to come across a branch of Polpo that I didn't know existed - I frequent the Covent Garden branch, so this was a pleasant surprise. We sat right at the back so had a good view of the restaurant, it is much lighter & more spacious than the CG version. The menu was as excellent as usual, and we ordered a pizzarette (?) from the specials board to compliment our always-a-winner chickpea meatballs. A carafe of very tasty house red was enjoyed too. Excellent service and friendly staff."
Great Japanese food & genuinely friendly service. I noticed the other day that they buy their ingredients from Tony's Continental on the High Road - first class ingredients make for first class meals. We are really lucky to have this little place in N2.
"the food wasn't anything special (big group of us so we had allot of the menu) the staff didn't want to be there and I think only one smiled at us! We had some loud drums that started just as we was all eating and talking so had to shout and couldn't really hear fellow pals. That said the atmosphere was great, the music was fab so would prob go again for the audience that goes and music to have a dance but I wasn't blown away with everything else."
"The food was good - I had the steak, which was a little to rare for me, so I asked if it could be cooked a little more, and they actually cooked me another one, which I wasn't expecting! The wine was excellent, and the dessert delicious - Bakewell tart and the most diveine custard. Considering just how packed it was (with a continuous queue outside) the service was pretty quick. And Anna, who served me, was very polite, accommodating, and friendly - she most certainly enriched my experience at Union Jacks. On top of all that, the location is fantastic - a great place when you've been shopping in Covent Garden, or if you're off to the theatre. Having read a previous review, I would say if you do like cheesy street performances, than the Opera House side is excellent in terms of view of them. A bit noisy if you want to chat though!"
Ate here in the interval between the Wolf Hall matinee and the Bring up the Bodies evening performance at the nearby Aldwych Theatre. It was a nice day so we sat outside at one of the pavement tables. Had a tuna nicoise salad with a tuna steak and a chicken and walnut salad - both excellent and large portions - followed by creme brulee (excellent flavour but just slightly too runny) and good espressos. Other diners' meals looked tasty as well and the fixed price pre-theatre menu looked excellent value. The young waiting staff were friendly and professional and the food was good value for such a central location. All in all a very pleasant experience. The only thing we did not like was the earthernware flask the tap water was served in. It looked attractive but the neck was so narrow we thought it would be very difficult to clean inside.
"We went on a Saturday night before the London marathon so that my son could carb up and he wasn't disappointed. Once you've worked out how it works, It's more relaxing. Need to allow plenty of time for the experience. If you want fast food, walk 5 mins to Pizza Express. The food is delicious, fresh and a great variety and value. They need to monitor the groups saving tables though. There were three women and a baby holding tables for about 20 people for a good hour behind us and others waiting at the door. Overall a great place and we will be back"
"We came here, just because we were looking for a place to watch a basketball game and were pleasantly surprised! The bartender was very nice and right away changed the tv to our game. So we stayed for a our early dinner. We got the bruschetta for the appetizer and it was sooo damn good! fresh and very flavorful which kind of ruined my fish and chips that I got for my main course, it seemed to lack flavor... Overall we enjoyed our meal and super nice service. Plus the place is big, so it didn't get too crowded.Great place to come for a game, beer and appetizers if you're in the area."
We're grateful that we found this lovely restaurant in Belgravia! Dinner was exceptional. We chose to sit outside as it was a lovely night. The staff were very professional and the interior looked quite lovely ... light and bright but the food was what we went for! We would highly recommend this restaurant!
Been twice over the last week (once with mother and once with boyfriend). When with boyfriend we had the calamari to start and then shared The Hardcore burger and Lobster Roll and when with my mother we had the Lobster Roll and Whole Lobster (with fries and mixed salad). All dishes were great. My only negative is the service is far too slow. In the evening I could understand but when I went the second time it was 4pm with 1 other table so not really an excuse. Also the waiters are really friendly when they see you but need to look around more as it took 5 mins of constant waving to try and get them to look up and see us. Service: 3/5Food: 4/5Price: 4/5Decor: 3/5
"The staff were so attentive and kind! Service is really important to me and they really delivered. The food was really good too, the chilli prawn spaghetti was gorgeous - as was the tiramisu!"
"I was told about this place but a local resident- it's the bomb.Friendly manager, nice atmosphere and most importantly- seriously good pizza!"
"What an amazing experience with first class food matched only by first class all inclusive entertainment by mine host Tom. Worth the trip from Melbourne for an experience to remember and, hopefully, repeat very soon."
"Really good service from arriveal, white bait starters cooked to perfection, a huge portion of scampi and excellent chips. All a a very reasonable price."
Good food and nice design right on Islington Upper street.Reasonable prices; Good menu;Fresh ingredients and friendly service.Probably one of the better restaurants of a kind.
"Best pizza ive had for a long time, usually we go to Santa Maria but have had a few sloppy pizzas from there now and always seem too busy, so a friend recommended to try Loro Di Napoli and I'm so glad we listened. Best pizza ive tried in England and extremely authentic we were sat right in view of the pizza oven, pizza was 10/10 service was 10/10 even down to the complimentary limoncello with the bill.Will be back regularly for sure!"
"Saturday evening dinner in the restaurant and our party of 4 all enjoyed a marvellous meal, accompanied by friendly and efficient service. One had haddock, two cod and one scampi - and we all came away singing the praises. I very much believe that we will be returning, and hopefully before too long."
"Two of us ate here on a dreadful wet night . We Arrived soaking wet, the owner promptly took our wet coats and we were seated next to the bar. The food was very good and service attentive and efficient.Fish soup was delightful, as was the ravioli. My main course was chicken with tarragon which came with new potatoes and spinach. My partner opted for the duck breast which was also very good. We both opted for the crÌ¬me brulee again very good.All in all, great food on a dreadfully wet evening.Will definitely return next time we come back to London."
Food was fresh and delicious with generous portions. Very lovely customer service and a nice place to dine. Would definitely recommend visiting this place and especially trying the chicken curry with a side of plantain.
"We popped into Goya the other night, have been there many times, but not for some time. The first thing that struck me was how sullen the waiters were. The waiter behind the bar did not smile all evening and acted like you were a inconvenience to him. The other waiters seems very stressed and moody. The food, which used to be great, was totally tasteless - all of it. The calamari was overcooked and the rest was bland. What's happened to this once great place? Where has the Spanish fun gone? such a shame as was a great local place. Up your game Goya - we all have many choices in that area. We wouldn't go again, as we Arrived happy and left depressed!!"
"My review is for the Wasabi, Sushi and Bento branch in Kings Cross Station, London. Fantastic location where you can sit and admire the modern architecture and 'people watch'. There is real energy in the atmosphere.The food is great, always fresh, delicious and good value for money, there are a wide range of dishes from a smipleSalmon Nigri (60 pence) to great Noodle Soups and Curry. Ther service is fast, it's one fo my favourite places to eat while travelling across London. There are a few chairs and tables, you may have to wait for one, but it's worth it! Enjoy!"
"Great value for money.Fresh,good choice for breakfasts and lunches.Comfortable seating."
"I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a special meal out. I will not reiterate the praise from previous reviews but it is well deserved. The only negative was that we went on a very quiet weekday evening, and having the waiter's undiveided attention meant that the first two courses Arrived rather too quickly. Once we asked for more time between courses, the meal proceeded at a more relaxed pace."
"With the sad demise of many Cafe Rouge restaurants in the West End, Cote makes an excellent, albeit slightly more expensive, alternative.Friendly, efficient staff serve excellent French brasserie style food in a bustling conviveial atmosphere.Consistent and a pleasure to visit."
"Ate here as a group of 6 and have to say was one of the best meals ive had, all time. Amazing set menu (in evenings), with local and other in season ingredients. The cooking and flavour combinations were perfect as well as being original, was lovely having something different rather than the same old things reconstituted things. I'd say it was rustic modern British cooking at its best, in a great bijou interior. The cheeses and charcuterie were amazing, it was all amazing, especially the staff, whom make it just as special. Will be going back soon."
"ive really grown tried with the local offerings for lunch around Bank, so I was only too eager to try this new little place some of my more trustworthy friends had recommended. Haven't always been a grill fan but ive been quickly won over with their seriously tasty skewers, particularly fond of the salmon ceviche, and cajun chicken - all pretty good value too. Menu is a little limited but apparently they're expanding soonish. Was enjoying the fact it felt a little hidden, but the secret's slowing getting out as I'm annoyingly bumping into more and more people from my office there."
"Booked this place for my mum's 60th birthday during our visit to London, hoping for a great choice of tasting food...Completly the opposite of my expectations. Terrific uncomfortable seats and dirty cutlery. Food portions were rediculous. Having to pay a fiver for 3 meatbals in ketchup! The taste of food was not best either and presentation was poor. Seems like everything is done in a rush with little attention. The state of menus was disgusting with dried up food all over them! The service on the other hand was good. My food orders were taken by blonde waitress she was quite informative and nice, the brunette waitress was also helpful and served us drinks. But we did have to wait quite a long while to recieve our food.Overall, having read a couple of nice reviews I expected better from Donde...do not set your expectations high. This place is good for a quick drink but not to spend your whole afternoon there."
"Had a great lunch with business colleagues and clients. Small setting, great food. Quick service. Some minor issues with delivery and bills, but all in all a very nice experience."
I visit Hazev quite often and always happy with the food and service.Lamb shish is my favourite and I am in love with deli section!
Great location near Trafalgar Square. Friendly and welcoming staff. Quite tight with seats close together as it is fairly small inside. A space for the folded pushchair was found. Food was okay but expensive for an ordinary family meal.
"I was looking for a restaurant within easy walking distance from the London Eye and Charing Cross station for a large group. I made an enquiry with the Hispaniola and I was contacted by the most helpful lady called Natasha who not only made our reservation but also sent the menu so our guests could have a look beforehand. We Arrived early and were seated at the front of the boat (there was a bit more movement upfront)!Initially we were given the wrong menu for the offer that I had booked so our party were disappointed not to receive a glass of bubbly but I did explain that we had not paid for it so there was no reason for complaint. The surroundings are lovely, tables well dressed and you have fantastic views of the Thames, Eye & Embankments. We ordered drinks which were reasonably priced and were offered fresh baked artisan rolls. We ordered 3 courses and between us tried all of the options from the set menu. Fish & chips resembled moby dick, risotto was delicious, and the pie and mash was perfect. All of the food was flavoursome and and of an excellent standard. I don't think there is a dress code on the Hispaniola however once inside you feel pleased you made a little effort especially in the evening when the piano starts to be played. It has a wonderful atmosphere and we found all of the staff very polite and eager to please. As we were a party of more than 8 the service charge was included on our bill. For good service I am happy to tip 15% but it was not that much. We were more than happy to leave this amount in recognition of the accommodating service which we received and the quality of the food."
Had a great pre theatre meal the set menu was super value Stunning views especially with Christmas lights The only thing was we were constantly asked if everything was OK Can restaurant staff look at the table and not interrupt when conversation flowing and diners obviously happy with clean plates
"The restaurant staff are very attentive and the food is top notch. It is my third visit and the standard is always high. A must for authentic Italian, fresh fish and sea food and wonderful steaks!"
"I am a sucker for a really well-crafted cocktail, and I loved this bar!! A little dark and down a dank set of steps, but right in cute Hoxton Square, and the ambience gives it the air of a speak-easy but without any attitude or intimidation, ha! Fave drink, by far, was the Bouquet Garni. Perfect for summer! Rather sweet, but the rosemary cuts right through the sweetness and makes it refreshing. Very lovely staff, too. Tops! Maybe someday they can add some bar noshes? I was quite hungry when I went, and that would have been a nice addition. Oh well, I just ordered another cocktail :)"
"Each time I'm in London I like to have a drink in this magic place, where the british atmosphere is still ""alive"", even if you can meet a lot of tourists everything is still ""british"" , this is very important because London has changed a lot so far....but I hope it keeps something to be unique."
"So we decided to bring the curtains down on our birthday months Sept and Oct at this place as we have not been before. The lay out was a bit weird for my liking one, but at the bar; it was impossible to get the bartenders to even look our way. So we decided to go to another end of the bar, and the bartender who ignored us all along came over about a minute after took our bar menu and said you cant order your drinks on this side. I was p*ssed! Because I took my friend thinking she would be impressed with my choice, we left the bar area back to our table and had a waitress get the drinks. Had one drink and left for another venue never ever to return. I was embarrassed and annoyed as hell, not so much for me but for taking my friend there. Aqua Neuva/ Spirit/ Kyoto you get both thumbs down."
"This is a great little winebar with a good selection, knowledgeable and friendly staff and a nice atmosphere. Good service, good wine and good music. Highly recommended!"
"A time to reminisce about the tutorials spent here in the 1980s. Though a short visit, the welcome was warm and pint of London Pride very pleasant indeed. Food looked good as it passed, but didn't have time to try it this time round. Though only a few yards from the Natural History Museum and Science Museum, it was quiet and friendly. Well worth a visit."
"An interesting concept of an extended wine bar that is clearly targeted at those in the city. I don't think I have eaten at a restaurant that is only open Monday to Friday and suspect that if you were looking for a fine dining experience at the weekend this would not necessarily have been a choice anyway. The restaurant is all about business, lunch or early dinner to fit in with the busy day!We were there for dinner with friends who had used the restaurant a bit for entertaining colleagues with business at Lincoln's Inn Fields. I can see the attraction. A bustling busy venue situated underground. The theme is clearly wine and there was a great selection of single glasses from which to choose. That said, I found the main wine list limited. The London mark-up on prices is a turn-off and if I was to do dinner again, would consider trying different wines with the food on offer. Service was functional and adequate. Food was designed to let the wines sing. Scallops for start and steak for main course were well prepared and presented. Struggling to recall what was memorable about the food and recall that chips were good.A satisfactory experience but made more so by the feeling that you were in the heart of London and sharing the wine experience with friends. Not sure that I would rush back when there look to be other similar establishments in the area that might be worth a try."
Visited after web research. We were given a warm welcome by a man called Tom; a personable Irish character. He sold the place well but unlike other places the food matched his description. My steak and Guinness pie was delicious with chunky chips and gravy (mmm). Apparently the cottage pie was v good as well but it disappeared before I could try it. One course was sufficient. As it is part of Hardy's pub you can get a drink or BYO for a small corkage fee. Great food and attentive service at a reasonable price. What more do you want?
"We had a table booked for Sunday Lunch but I don't think it was necessary as the restaurant was pretty quite. The staff were really nice and attentive but not so the food. The starter of mushrooms were tiny button mushrooms on a small piece of toasted bread and was nothing special. The main course was roast beef but was not that nice at all. Two slices which were med-med rare which is not a problem but not a lot of meat at all. Veg was a bit over cooked as well. The biggest disappointment was the wooden block it was served on. I hate food presented on slates and pieces of wood! Cant be very hygienic either. Sorry to say but we wouldn't be going again. I think you can see a similar review just before this one on the same day below mine, not related by the way, so probably they didn't get it right on the day."
"Food was amazing as always at TGI Fridays, I would recommend the new hotdogs, and all the starters are gorgeous! The service was brilliant, took a while for us to get seated but it is a busy area so no surprise there, the waiter who served us was friendly, polite and very accommodating. He even offered me the children's dessert menu when I was too full for a pudding and this was perfect for me."
"Heads up...it is expensive and not appropriate to go in tourist garb. The food was excellent and portions were huge. Very classy, quality place. Service right on. Definitely not your average London pub. Treat yourself, you probably deserve it. Jil and Marty from the US of A (NYC and Delray Beach, FL)"
"Was really looking forward to visiting this cafe. Staff were friendly and attentive quickly finding us a table. I had the fish and chips and my son chose the children's pizza. I agree with previous comments it would be nice if re plates were warm as the food Coles down quickly, it was a warm day perhaps they are warmed when it it cold? The fish was ok I was expecting nice rustic chips but instead French fries, for £15 it was I thought over priced and not very flavoursome. The children's menu is competitively priced but didn't wow my son and he had the pizza but didn't get the potatoes and a stick with carrot & cucumber not very filling. Desserts are limited choice and expensive £6 for Black Forest gateau. I think you are paying for the location more than the food. Nice enough but there are plenty of other restaurants that over good tasty food."
"Love love this place for a quick lunch after hours of shopping. Food is always delicious, Thai flavours on point, the squid for starter and the cod fillet stir fry are to die for.. Stir fries and noodle dishes are better than the curries but most dishes has all the Thai flavours. One of the yellow curries a little bland but fish sauce will do the trick. Shame they don't do desserts, a mango and sticky rice pudding would make the whole experience perfect.Service is great, very happy staff although sometimes I think they are like robots because I have been referred to as LADIES""everything ok LADIES, anything I can do for you LADIES"" even though am on my own or with my hubby.Not sure about sharing a table with strangers...a little less priveate if you want to talk about personal stuff..they do have a few seats for 2 but not enough.Love the take away boxes,very nice. Have recommended to lots of Thai food lovers and I will sure return."
"Having settled into our condo in Covent Garden we began to explore the area. After walking along the Thames we came back to home via the Covent gardens. We stopped at the first place we found; Union Jack's. What a treat. The night was cool so the heaters were appreciated. Service was great. The drinks satisfying. The food, especially the sticky toffee pudding, was very good. A great start to our week in the UK."
on Tuesday nights from 7.30 to 10 the small top bar hosts live jazz - we enjoyed female singer and two piece band : seats less than 40 so you must book unless you want to standunderstand entry with one drink and decent sort of appetizer plate for 2 is about £20 a head - four of us went on a voucher deal for £8 each so this represented excellent value and we had a really good evening I guess £20 a head isnt onerous for entertainment and a drink and nibbles but if you can get it cheaper why not - from our point of view it made a great mid week night out and the add on prices for additional drinks were not excessivewe even managed to dance as we had seats at the back - any closer and it would have been very loud
We got a last minute cancellation at the Chef's Table for my mum's 50th and it most definitely didn't disappoint! You are told to pace yourself as the menu is a complete surprise (we also advised them of any dietary requirements beforehand). The food was delicious and the experience was fantastic - I won't give too much away but dessert was superb and is an experience in itself! Would highly recommend the Chef's Table as a fun night out
"Surprisingly italian-authentic pizza (don't expect that from a pub). Enjoyable service, nice beer and artisinal gin selections."
"This is by far the best restaurant in the area in my opinion. Food is always stunning and the atmosphere very cosy and friendly. Because the idea is to have a few things to share, you get yo try a number of different dishes - yet to find something I didn't like. ive been there for lunch and dinners and always very happy with the food and service. Would recommend to everyone!"
"This is the best Japanese restaurant that I have visited in London. The set meal with 5 courses is just perfect in quantity and the presentation is impeccable. The place is tiny so make sure to reserve in advance.Good selection of wines by the glass to accompany the meal. Only thing, its not cheap, but you pay for the quality."
"Unglamourous from the outsideBasic decor But food is incredible, worth it, the beef buglogi is great and the KFC is the best ive ever tasted. Prices are decent too I didn't know what to order so the waiter spent a good 5 minutes recommending dishes to me and I loved them all!"
"The restaurant is a short walk from King's Cross station and it is quite unassuming. Inside is plainly decorated. Good service, efficient, very polite as you would expect. Had the Itadaki Cours noodles set which has several courses. The presentation of the food reminiscence pieces of art. The sushi was fantastic unlike the certain conveyor belt restaurants. Had the sesame pudding which is a good finish to a good meal. At the end of the meal I felt content there was nothing greasy or full of salt. You can get food cheaper than this place but no where as good.Would recommend a visit if you like Japanese food."
"We came here for afternoon tea for Mother's Day/mother's birthday and had an amazing day. Great service from Inna, with delicious food and free flowing bubbles. Would definitely come back again!!!"
"Has a really cool vibe, lot's of fun and the food is fantastic as were the Tom Collins drinks that the bar team made"
Love going back to wagamama;s. didnt like the fact that the chilly oil is now a paid addition. ordered the spicy chicken curry with rice (all of them are spicy and I cant remember the name now)
"We decided to stop at restaurant for a quick bite Saturday afternoon. We used to come hear a lot and were curious to see if the food was still good. We sat at the bar, by the window (there is a large dining area in the basement and tables outside). On offer is an extensive list of tapas, mostly priced at £5-8. We ordered: pollo croquetes, artichoke with ham, spinach with chickpeas and tortilla (the only true disappointment as it was too dry). Service was efficient, so much so we were in and out in 20 minutes. Expect simple, well seasoned and good size portions at cheap prices."
"We Arrived, as planned, for our 9pm sitting on Saturday evening. The table designated for us was not available so the four of us had to make do with a table suitable for two. Whilst irritating, it did not detract from the evening. The service is excellent, Team Villa Vianca, headed by Mr Luccini, ensure that ourselves and everyone else are well taken care of. When ordering, be patient, it's worth it. We had Grilled Chicken, Lobster Seafood, Veal Milanese and Dover Sole. All beautifully prepared. We chose a Chianti Reserve which complimented the meal perfectly. Our starters varied, including a selection of salads, minestrone and olives. Villa Bianca has had something of a renaissance these past two years. It is local, extremely full and very busy. Lots of chat and buzz. Will continue to visit."
"We wanted an early afternoon tea with 'free flowing champagne' and the Reform Social and Grill in the Mandeville Hotel provided exactly what we were looking for. The vintage champagne did not stop flowing during the 2 hours we were dining. The food was fairly typical for afternoon tea, with neat little sandwiches, scones with jam and cream and a number of fancy cakes/pastries. After initially wondering whether there may be delays between champagne refills, we were pleasantly surprised to receive 'top ups' more frequently than anticipated. In all we may of received 7 or 8 glasses each. There are a number of agents offering special rates for this venue - including AfternoonTea.co.uk and Bookatable. The restaurant is comfortable and nicely decorated but does not have views. The staff are very friendly and attentive. Excellent value for money !!"
You can enjoy the food from choosing from the round moving bar and take different colored plates and pay accordingly
"I went to this place yesterday for the second time, and I loved it just as much as the first. The restaurant seems very cosy, and the tables are placed quite close to each other. they have a variety of seating which can accommodate any sort of outing (with friends, partners and family).They have a complete Asian menu, from the far East, a variety of sushi dishes which are always really well presented, and some rice and noodle dishes too. This time, I tried their Pad Thai, It was so tasty. They were able to add the extras that I required without any problems. I tried the vegetarian duck pancakes, the spring rolls and the deep fried prawns. they were very tasty and well balanced. If I was being really picky, I would say the hoisen sauce was a bit too sweet. The main dishes were delicious. I love the fact that the Jasmine tea is refillable! The waiters provide chopsticks and forks and spoons.As for the prices, I think it is good value for money. there is a lot of food for the price you pay. for Me, I went with 3 friends ( 4 of us in total), we ordered 3 starters, 4 mains and 4 drinks and we paid £51.I would recommend this place for a nice relaxed afternoon or dinner. It is usually busy at all times so, make sure you aren't too hungry to wait!"
Really enjoyed our meal on on the Hispaniola. It wasn't cheap but I suppose you were also paying for the views and fact that you are in London. I had scallops to start and my husband had wood pigeon. I then had lamb which was beautiful and my husband had rib eye steak. The gentleman on the table next to us complained about the size of his rib eye but my husband's was an ok size and well cooked. We weren't rushed in any way and the service was very good. Couldn't wish for a nicer view as you look across the Thames to the London eye
Visited London and was doing the Stamford bridge tourist thing.We didn't know where to go and came across this place.To be honest we didn't know what to choose because it all looked so good.I went for the famous fish & chips... chunkiest chips ive ever had i can confirm they are not lying they are indeed now famous!my boyfriend had toad in the hole... really well presented and delicious.This is definitely on our list of places to hang out when we are next in town.
"We had a 5pm dinner before going to the theatre. At about £15 for a three course meal it was very good value.I had a smoked salmon starter followed by seafood linguine- both of which were very tasty. Puddings in our party were crime caramel, chocolate mousse and dark chocolate pot. All were very nice!We'd come back."
This restaurant could be so much more. The service was very good and we were very pleased with the wine which had been a recommendation but the food was disappointing. My starter of buffalo mozzarella and sweet peppers was actually quite good with the cheese being really soft and creamy. I followed with a type of sliced beef fillet. I had asked for medium rare but received medium. The outside was hard and tasted a bit burnt. It came with a jus containing mushrooms. This had a very strong flavour to the point of being almost impalatable. Desert was a panna cotta which may have been hanging around a bit too long as was served in a glass and had become thick around the edges and stuck to the sides of the glass. My companions fared a little better but found their dishes rather bland. I didn't really care for the decor. It is a very small space and cou;d have been so much more. The random pieces of art on the walls really didn't work. I doubt if we will return.
"Chanced upon this chippy when we were in London and was pleasantly surprised, its more of a restaurant than a chipper - you can have a glass of wine with your food but you still get chip shop chips ;) its a small place but has a nice cosy atmosphere. Food was really tasty and service was eficient."
Tried this restaurant for the first time when my family were visiting. We had a coffee and cake on Saturday afternoon and brunch the following Sunday morning. Both times the service and food was excellent. Will use again if in the area.
"It's a bit expensive for what it is, but it's an easy choice when you need some food quickly while still avoiding places like McDondalds. Great to grab a sandwich and some fruit while touring the city and don't have to time to sit-in somewhere. Great thing about Pret is that they are all the same so you know what to expect."
"Great varied and tasty lunch options for adults and children. We visited Green Park which was busy but clean, quick and tasty!"
"We came to the restaurant around 7:30. The place was full of people but it looked as if stuff members are missing. We waited because the place looked good. Set to the table around 8:24. There was no host to take our names or say something. Just a manager who told us to wait 20 minuts for 3 times. The food was good, but when I asked for lemon and salt I never got them. Not even after finishing my food. Not once a stuff member asked us if everything is ok. So we didn't order desserts. Since we never got a service it was the first time in my life that I didn't leave tip."
"Great lunch in a wonderful setting, food and service were really good.Had a window table overlooking the Thames, weather was idyllic, sunshine and blue skies.I had the smoked mackerel mousse to start, wasn't quite what I was expecting but tasted diveine. The meals were generous in size.When we Arrived the tide was out, therefore it was a very steep decent onto the boat, I was very glad I was wearing flat shoes - could of had an accident in heels. After the meal the tide had come in and the gangway back to the embankment was almost level."
"What a beautiful experience for our first afternoon tea in London! The room and table is beautiful. A pianist plays standards in the gorgeous lobby area of the salon to add to the classic ambiance. The service was excellent from start to finish. The tea was perfect, and the food was fabulous! It's expensive, but a worthwhile indulgence, especially since you can order as many refills as you like on both the tea and food. We were happy that we booked close to lunch time - we left absolutely stuffed! You are given a selection of the standard afternoon tea (a mix of sandwiches and pastries/cakes), the ""savoury"" afternoon tea (same amount of food, but all savory instead of sweet - still includes a selection from the dessert cart at the end), and the high tea, for which you choose a main dish to enjoy with a smaller selection of cakes/sandwiches. I believe they also had a vegetarian tea option, which is nice. We opted for the savoury tea, and it was a great choice. The tea sandwiches and the savory scones were delicious, but the savory specialties included in place of cakes/pastries were to die for. For only 1 pound more than the traditional tea, it also seemed like a better value to us, because you were getting things like a truffle pastry puff, pate, and lobster salad. And you still get your sweet tooth fix at the end anyway! I'll also point out that if you have more than one person, you can each order a different version of the tea and then share everything. Of course, each person gets their own indiveidual pot of perfectly steeped, loose leaf tea which is poured through a strainer into your cup. What a treat! I enjoyed the Royal blend while my husband loved his Earl Grey. Our neighboring table ordered the tea tasting (which is an extra 10-15 pounds per table - not per person) and from what I could see, that seems like a great thing to add on for a special occasion. A waiter visited their table multiple times with a tray of various teas and explained each one to them. As your standard tea only includes one selection of tea, that seems like a great option. Not sure why we didn't do it ourselves!Our server was courteous and knowledgeable, and despite how busy they were, we never felt rushed. In fact, she encouraged us to get multiple refills. My only disappointment was that it had to end at all! Definitely book in advance - we couldn't believe it was full on a Monday afternoon."
This restaurant is very convenient before or after concerts at the Albert Hall.We enjoyed the food and were well looked after.
"I recently visited East London and thought I would pop in for some Pie & Mash. Kelly's has been in the Roman Road for years and in the past was famous for serving up a decent Pie & Mash. Not so now though, the pie & mash were both lukewarm and the only flavour I could find was in the vinegar. I would not recommend this."
"Upon first arriveing at the ship, it did look a little naff to say the least. It is sponsored by benefit make up, so well geared to us ladies. Pink bunting, tired looking exterior paint and men dressed in sailors outfits greet you upon bording. We started in the pink bar, which would be great for hen parties, but not really right for our corporate group! The restaurant is a completely different ball game. Food was amazing, service great and atmosphere quite sophisticated. The steak was cooked to perfection, and duck starters were melt in the mouth moreish. Desserts need a little technical refresh to keep up with the starters and mains in quality. Quite an enjoyable place to eat."
"friendly service but food was pretty uninspiring; Starters accompanied by bland dipping sauces, my tofu main was an overly-oily stir fry. Disappointing.Dinner for three (a cocktail each, starters, mains and one bottle of wine) came in at £105 so not exactly cheap. Won't be going back."
"We only stopped in for a few drinks, but it was a great experience! Service was friendly, and the beer was excellent. The chocolate beer specifically is worth a try!"
"At £17 for two courses this was excellent value for a classic fish and chips meal. Extras bumped up the bill but the basic value couldn't be faulted. The deal applies to early evenings only but that wasn't a problem on this occasion. Service was a bit lacking in personality, but overall a good meal."
"A great overall experience! Cosy atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff, cocktails to start at the bar (totally worth it), good wine, the minted lamb was perfect and the Yorkshire desserts were a great surprise !! I don't usually eat Yorkshire pudding but I totally recommend trying these (both savoury and dessert) as they were both diveine...! I look forward to the next visit!"
We had a lovely dinner. The sushi was very good. Everything feels fresh and is well presented. Good service
"Great 4 floor venue , usually go there before and after chelsea games and a great atmosphere here. Food is fantastic , ground floor trad pub, first floor restaurant , second floor members, big roof terrace at the top.Highly recommend"
"I would definitely recommend a visit here. Brilliant Flat Iron Steak cooked medium rare as recommended. Roasted Aubergine was delicious & I would recommend the Beef Dripping cooked Chips. Brilliant atmosphere with warm & friendly staff. Don't expect to walk in & get seated during busy periods, we had an hour wait & want for drink in Covent Garden while we waited. We then got a text when our table was ready. We would definitely eat here again next time we're in Covent Garden."
"Authentic Japanese setting and food very good and well presented though portions could be a bit more generous for the price. Also, they do serve beer so why can't they also serve tea? I think brown rice would also be an improvement on the rice they do serve (not sure what it was - organic white rice mixed with bran? Very odd). Waitress very helpful and friendly but a bit overworked on a busy Saturday night. Well worth a visit, especially if you like Japanese food AND are vegan or vegetarian."
"This is some very, very nice coffee. Perfect for breakfast or to top up if you're in the area. When the weather's nice, ideal to just sit outdoors and people-watch Kingsland Rd."
"I used to come here in the late 90s and having gone there a few weeks ago was pleased that it had barely changed. The cocktails are fab, the red wine drinkable and a lovely cosy, though slightly noisy atmosphere!"
"The service ranked as the worst Nandos experience ive ever had. In a process where the customer does all the work to save you from doing it this system at this time on a Saturday evening was very poor. I get having to wait a little long for our order after the peek time, but 30mins is a bit much. Would have been nice to have been offered a few nuts or olives to tide us over, but I bought those!! The killer was when the food did arrive having to wait for someone to ask to replenish the cutlery stand and the reception I got was priceless, shame the nuts were not. Bite ones lip and shake ones head.The food, its Nandos cant really get that wrong?? Sweetcorn needs to be both soft and sweet but hey cant win them all.I really do like Nandos - truly not a hater. But this location for me Nil points. I had to give one as zero was not an option. Not a good end to a lovely evening we had had previously."
"There are three great reasons to visit the Bridge Cafe: 1. The service is great. If you are hungry and need to eat fast then this is the place for you. We were welcomed at the door, ordered at the counter and our mugs of tea turned up in less than a minute. The food turned up no more than five minutes later. Excellent. During our lunch the owner chatted and showed a genuine interest in us. 2. The food is great. This is exactly what you want from a working Cafe. Proper breakfasts, sandwiches that need to be picked up with both hands, hot pies and crisp, chunky chips. Steaming mugs of proper tea and a choice of either red or brown sauce. The large slabs of bread in our butties was fresh, buttered and delicious. Sausages were thick, meaty and way above average. And in my book any one who serves Pukka pies is on to a winner. We recommend that the Bridge consider stocking the Chicken Balti pies as well. 3. Location is great. Just off the A40, Western Avenue this is an ideal place for Breakfast or Lunch on your way into or out of London. Put Alliance Road, W3 in your Sat Nav. And for fans of the BBC TV show Apprentice yes this is the place where the loosing team goes to, moan and perform the post task postmortem. The fame does not seem to have changed anything at Bridge Cafe. It does what it does well. I delivers good quality traditional British food at good honest prices with a warm welcome and a bit of from the owner. Can not wait to go back for the full English"
"I have been to Tom's about 5 times now and every time is even better than the last. The service, the relaxed atmosphere, Tom's friendly banter and not to mention the delicious food are what keeps us coming back. Will be back again in the new year :)"
"I live in Ealing and ive tried various other pizza places that are really very good but I decided to come here with my girlfriend as the reviews and articles make it seem like a big deal. Firstly we sat down and ordered starters they were just ok nothing to shout about. Then came the pizza. It was very doughy, the base in the middle soggy and too wet and the cheese and ham was ok. There was no checking on us to see if we were ok. We were hungry so we ate. The waiters didn't even let us finish our pizzas before they wanted to take our plates. We felt so uncomfortable and rushed. I don't care how good they think their food is service must always be first. Good service can save a bad meal as they say. They definetely need to take that into consideration next time. This place also has a cold vibe and atmosphere you feel it's trying to be a generic italian restaurant. Certainly don't feel you've stepped into Naples. Tiramisu size could of been more generous. Lastly all I can say is that this is certainly not the best pizza in London and take all those articles with a pinch of salt. I assume it was the talk of the town few years ago as one of the first ""Naples style pizza joints"" in London before it became fashion but now that there is a lot of competition for SM in Ealing itself and London, they really need to up their game. The benchmark is very high now and the pizza is forgettable. Won't be back."
"Great restaurant, with history, beautiful interior design with very high ceilings, helpful and friendly waiters, and wide variety of food.For that do not like German food, there is also a wide variety of salads, sandwiches, brunch menu, meats, fish, and more. The menu can be seen on their website.I turned up with no reservation, there was a queue for the reception but it went quite quick. There were a couple of hostesses helping out; one of them though had no idea, when I mentioned I had no reservation she told me ""come back another day"", then asked to the hostess next to her behind the computer and she was able to provide me a table within seconds.If you happen to be in the King's Cross area I'd highly recommend giveing it a try. I will go back to try more dishes while enjoying the pleasant atmosphere!"
"This was my first ""Jamie"" experience and it was lovely. The food was exactly as advertised. I had the fish n' chips and was very happy. Obviously since it is in the middle of Covent Garden, it was a bit pricy-er than what I would usually pay for the same meal, but it was not outrageous. Overall, fun atmosphere, better than average service, and great food. Will go back and take my ""tourists"" when they visit."
"Nice bar, with reasonable prices for central London, didn't eat but the menu looked pleasant. The staff were really polite although the same round cost us two different prices, but as it was cheaper for the second round we didn't argue. Apparently its the oldest licensed premises in London, but was still nicely decorated etc. We all had a good time and soaked in the friendly atmosphere. We would definately visit again!"
"Great sandwiches, drinks in a fast food setting for tourists on the go. All over London, just look around and you'll find them."
"The Groucho has celebrated 30 years with a makeover (It now has a lift, to the great relief of members staying after a night's exertions).Members and guests can choose from the restaurant, brasserie or bar snacks. The food is of a consistently high standard, with many old favourites and excellent new dishes.If you're a member you might grumble about some of the changes to the decor (a Groucho tradition). If you're invited as a guest, jump at the chance because it's a unique experience. The staff are superb, and the fine art throughout adds the finishing touch."
"I went for a late lunch alone and ordered crab fried rice and lychee Lasse. The crab fried rice were too salty and were not very tasty. The Lasse was decent though. I won't be visiting again unfortunately. I should have opted for some other dish maybe that would have been better. Based on my experience on this occasion, very disappointed."
9 of us ate of which one was Gluten Free .... ALL of our food was to a high quality and satisfied completely even down to the side salad and homemade mushy peas (higly recommended!). Staff accommodated us even though we were late for our booking (sorry!).... Can't wait to go again. You must try it out too!
I love this place where we can enjoy so nice authentic Japanese foods with so reasonable prices. Their mackerel sushi (Matsu-mae sushi) is excellent. Don't miss it!
"Luckily you can find one at every corner in London. Lovely freshly prepared sandwiches, bread rolls and wraps, a range of salads and fruit and something for your sweet tooth as well. Everything's labelled with nutrition facts and looks just delicious. More expensive if you stay in and not take the food out but that's your choice. Great coffee as well.And I don't know what they do to the staff but everybody was just so so friendly and had smiles on their faces. They're doing a really good job here."
"This is one of London's classic restaurants that I think can never disappoint: a menu with enough tradition to be comfortable and enough edge to be interesting. I had cod in liquorice powder and it was just fab, with very subtle flavours. And then I had a very light fish soup with fregola, where the tomato base was to die for. Tables well spaced so you don't feel crowded, and conversations cant be overheard. Service at the restaurant was amazing, although the same can't be said for the bar, where no one greeted us and sat us down when we Arrived, and it took ages to get anyone to take our order. All in all, a great choice for a business dinner (I would find it too formal for a dinner with friends)."
"My visit coincided with the Equinox party. Lovely atmosphere, good service. Food is good, still way overpriced! I'll give it maximum points for ambience and character. Interesting"
"If your on the run and want something healthy, tasty, and convenient, you can't go past Pret. Healthy, tasty, great variety, and you can always find something you like. They even use organic milk in their coffee. Beats Maccas by so far it's not funny. The new standard in fast food"
"Had the misfortune to visit Union Jacks in Covent Garden recently . I cannot eat butter which I explained to the server and went for the Lamb shank as it for me looked the safest bet . The server came back to say that there was butter in the parsnip puree , which was fare enough . I requested that instead it might be replaced with crispy onions which was part of another dish so was not some thing that had to especially cooked . I was told the chef would not change any of the ingredients to any of the dishes . I last came across this attitude about 15 years ago and thankfully today most restaurants are happy to cater fro customer needs --- clearly not the case with Mr Oliver . Whether fame and fortune has gone to his head and he thinks he can dictate what you are going to eat despite your likes and dislikes or he just knows best it is not a customer friendly attitude . Me and my wife left without eating to find somewhere that would be happy with our custom ."
My visit here was by accident as I was annoyed at the lack lustre service and horrendously expensive Electric Diner in Portobello Road. I came in here for dessert but wish I had come here in the first place. Much to rave about but its less then half the price for most items in the electric diner and they don't have the same lofty smug attitude either. Eat here its great
I am a regular at the anthologist and have always found the food and service excellent. I visited earlier in the week and they have changed the menu. Wow.... I am surprised they have managed to fine tune what I thought was an great menu. The dishes are seasonal and the choice fantastic.
"After experiencing rather rude service at a high end restaurant last time we visited London , chortle matte was a pleasant contrast. Our waiter was enthusiastic about the menu and gave great recommendations. The food was impeccable, albeit pricey, and the presentation was well thought out. We liked how the dishes were brought out in the best order to be eaten - it seemed like the waiters weren't just there to serve and they actually cared about the quality of the food. Only negative would be that it did take a while to have all the dishes as they come out at different times, However that's because it was all cooked to order! the overall experience was brilliant and I would definitely return here again ."
"We love Delicuiosly Ella and had to visit, so it was brilliant that Ella popped in and we were able to say hello and get a selfie.Lunch was fabulous, a great idea for lunch to have the selection of 4 items. The hot stews were amazing, lots of flavoursome food and all so healthy.Nice seating area downstairs but it was full so we sat at the higher tables at the front window, which was great as we would. It have seen Ella."
"Decided to go there as me and my girlfriend were in a bit of rush to visit some museums and didn't have much time to look for restaurants . We ordered some bruschetta as starters. That thing is nowhere near a bruschetta. As main I took a vegetarian calzone. The dough had nor the consistency neither the taste of one.The filling was cold. The place was clearly over packed as they put chairs and tables very close together to try ""maximize"" the space available to the point where to move around one had to interrupt someone else's lunch . To be fair the waitress made an effort to be sympathetic. In summary it was very very expensive from what was on offer and I have to blame only myself for being lazy and not walking a bit more to find a decent place."
"We had an amazing breakfast this morning at Paradiso. Orange juice and smoothy, flat white and hot chocolate with a full English Breakfast and eggs on toast. Lovely service and freshly prepared breakfast. Very nice"
"You can't go wrong digging in to a place like this, but somehow you may get disappointed. Not because the place isn't nice. Not because the food isn't great. Basically because it's so damn ordinary, and somehow you may expect a little more than the ordinary in a nice place like this."
"Let me start by saying the prices are ridiculous anyway. Nearly £30 for a main course of veal schnitzel is not appropriate outside of a michelin starred restaurant (as good as the schnitzel was, and it was really good). But the worst thing was, when we asked for chips instead of new potatoes with our schnitzel they gave us two chips. TWO CHIPS. I think for a £30 main that really takes the p***.The dessert was good (I had the mousse) but a little odd tasting (it came with pretzels which didn't really go) and the service was ok, if not outstanding. The waitress was pleasant but there was a wait for our desserts, and at times we had to work to catch waiting staff's attention. Felt they were not really deserving of the full 12% added service charge. I'd go again, but only to the bar area downstairs which for some reason is cheaper (but still not exactly cheap). And only if there weren't other better options available nearby."
"My wife and I decided upon this restaurant after a matinee performance of ""Phantom of the Opera"" and before our next show ""Impossible"".at the very nearby Noel Coward Theatre.Both dishes were well presented and both delicious, I had the Roast Duck Breast and my wife had the Lamb Cutlets.Do yourself a favour and make a booking as the restaurant gets very busy as it is situated in the West End and very close to most theatres. You wil not be disappointed."
"A Saturday afternoon visit and it was busy! But in a good way... lots going on and had a real atmosphere to the place! Service is good but not rushed- staff are good fun- the owner himself and his mother was working which was great to see! Food-Can't fault it! Really really good, fresh and clean. The Calamari was the best I have tasted, very light and not over cooked. Oysters looked great and tasted even better! This is a great little English find in the heart of Camden. Just get there early to guarantee a table! Enjoy and well done seawise for getting it spot on!"
"Had high hopes for this place, but let down in many ways - where do I start?!After tasting our cocktails we realised the guy who made them had no idea what he was doing, they tasted awful - and at £11 each we were hoping for something a bit more than a couple of shots in a tiny little cocktail glass.The food tasted good, but very small portions - after 3 courses we left the place still feeling hungry, and we by no means have enormous appetites. For a restaurant that size it took quite a while for courses to show up at our table, much longer still for the cheese board which they forgot about entirely!During our final course, the hapless barman then spilt hot candle wax down my jacket and trousers (still trying for a solution to get the oily stains out!) and we were offered our cheese board & glass of desert wine free of charge. If the stains don't come out that's £150 of clothes I have to throw away - not really made up by what we were offered. When trying to discuss the situation with the manager he was very dismissive, and kept moaning about the bills he had to pay!During the night we were told there would be live jazz music and we assumed this to be in the style of Django Reinhardt (with his face plastered all over the restaurant!) - instead we got an aussie piano player playing mostly american stuff.Avoid."
"I have been here a few times now and it is always great. Very easy, not bad value and a great choice of food! The dim sum is better than a lot of places around and the choice of food is generally good, and there is the healthy options if you want them. There is also a great cocktail menu. The staff are very kind."
"Went here last Sunday, and had possibly the worst service I have ever experienced from any establishment. After my friends had Arrived, stood for 15 minutes to be told that they would have a half an hour wait in a half-empty restaurant I Arrived and we stood to be taken to our table. After standing near the front of the restaurant for 10 minutes with all nearby staff ignoring us we politely informed the waitress that we we were ready to sit down, this is where the first of many rude and dirty looks were thrown at us by the staff. We were informed that she was 'just a waitress' and we would have to wait for James before she turned her back on us and continued cleaning one of the many tables that the staff seemed to think it was important clean for the non-existent customers than actually serving the existing ones. James finally turned up and we were sat down and given menus. We then waited 20 minutes to order with countless staff walking straight past our table, I politely asked a waiter if he knew who our waiter was and was greeted with yet again another one of the dirtiest looks I have ever experienced. Without even stopping to acknowledge me he continued walking past and said 'yeah she'll be here in a minute'. 5 minutes later 2 waitresses turned up with food for other tables. I politely informed one that we were ready to order to which she responded 'yeah she'll do it in a minute' gesturing to the other waitress, she then moved to a different table, who had been seated 10 minutes AFTER us and proceeded to serve them!!!! Finally our waitress turned up at our table and greeted us with 'right I'm here now' with the third dirty look. By this point we had had enough of being treated like rubbish when all we wanted to do was have a nice goodbye meal. We decided to leave, the waitress stormed off with no form of apology and we demanded to see a manager. The manager was very polite and helpful and this obviously hasn't reflected on a single member of his staff, who in my opinion should have no place in a customer service environment. They ruined our evening and I am shocked at how badly they feel they can treat another human being, let alone a customer in their restaurant who merely wanted to order some food. Disgusting."
We have eaten in a number of Tas restaurants and have found that their menu prices have gradually crept up with the quality not always being there. We ate at this branch on Sunday and 4 of us had the 'group menu' at £23.45 for 2 courses. Whilst it looks like a lot of food the reality was that we only had a spoonful of each of the starters (excepting the humus). The main courses were fine but the moussaka is not like the Greek version and comes in a tomato sauce. All in all it was nice but with the 12.5% service charge and a bottle of wine we felt the £32 per person price tag was not worth it and will probably eat in the Real Greek round the corner in future.Service was efficient.
"This place is a great neighborhood cafe, excellent coffee and food, friendly staff and cool ambience."
"This used to be my favourite restaurant in London. Service was excellent, and staff engaged. The food was world class. I have recommended Raka to many, and have taken many friends and family to eat there. Unfortunately I have now decided that I need to highlight my poor experiences this month. On two occasions, my take away deliveries have not been fulfilled. On one occasion after an hour and ten minutes I called to find they hadn't started my order. Once again this evening my order was not fulfilled. After an hour I called to once again find they hadn't picked up my order. This time I cancelled. I started cooking my own meal only for the order to then be delivered 15 minutes later.My suggestion is that you should avoid ordering for delivery. If you are able to visit the restaurant, then it is recommended. I would however strongly suggest you do not order off their website... There is a strong chance you're order will be forgotten."
"We have been here 3 times now, and we feel that the food is getting better, which is always something we really like (some restaurants we feel precisely the other way). We have tried some Vietnamese in London and this seems to be one of the good ones."
"It isn't much to look at. But it warm, rustic, and has amazing hot chocolate! They serve hot chocolate the way it should be. Nice and rich and not some cheeky instant variety. The server was okay. He was just mad busy and trying to keep up."
"Came with my partner expecting something really special for our afternoon tea . The staff were great, however, for a 5* establishment I did not expect to have sandwiches which had obviously been out in the air for a time, as the bread was dry and crispy. The cakes and tea were lovely tho"
History and spectacle. Great place to visit. Many points of interest over and above the crown jewels. Grab one of the tours given by the Yeoman Warders (Beefeaters). These guys will see you right. Funny and very informative. Would happily visit again.
"Would go again, had the vegetarian ravioli for main, not the most flavoursome so would hope to choose something different next time. Was served by Edward, great manners and service and chatty. The ambience was great and would definitely go back again. Would not hesitate to recommend."
"Very average Japanese food, with samples of Thai, Vietnamese. I'm visiting from my hometown where I'm very used to superb and authentic Japanese cuisine, but if you're just looking for a basic California roll here will do just fine. As is normal with sushi restaurants, don't plan on having an alcoholic drink with your meal, the selection is poor."
"The Park Terrace is made up of two areas: a bar area at the entrance, and the actual restaurant which is on both sides of the bar area. We weren't hungry enough for a full meal in the restaurant, so we sat at a table in the bar area and ordered drinks and a charcuterie plate to share, which was just about right for us. Very tasty meats and breads, but there were a lot of other snacks available that also looked good.The second time we ate here, we had afternoon tea in the restaurant. Park Terrace serves afternoon tea starting as late as 5:30 pm, which was convenient because we had an afternoon tour that day. I really liked the fact that they brought us little jars of tea leaves to sniff to help us choose a tea. There were also tasty sandwiches, fresh scones and delicious little cakes. The staff was very friendly, and the place was still packed when dinner time rolled around, possibly because it was a Saturday. Definitely book early if you want to have tea here on the weekend."
"I was taken to this Nando's before a theatre visit and, having not been to this venue before, I was pleased by how lovely it was, even though it's tucked away in Cardinal Place, so do seek it out {head for escalators with Wagamama signs & the M&S then turn right and it's at the end of that walkway}. It was the usual Nando's food magic which never disappoints - fresh, succulent, lots of condiments, unlimited soft drinks, it's all simply superb. This place was busy at 17.30 and I expect it to be busy all day. Seating outside and inside with loads of areas to choose from. My friend says he's been here at lunchtime and it's been really packed, so be warned if you're in a lunchtime hurry, though they may do pre-orders {it's worth asking about, on those days when only Nando's will do}. We had a sharing platter (1/2 chicken, chips & coleslaw with soft drinks) all for £19.95 which is exceptional . . we couldn't even manage dessert we were so full.Toilets are 3 separate bathrooms, well taken care of and roomy up a flight of stairs (so do ask in advance if you have accessibility issue)  Nando's never disappoints. I'll certainly be re-visiting this branch soon I'm sure."
Food is always high quality - just writing this review is making my mouth water! I particularly go for the tandoori trout when it is available.
"A truly excellent independent Italian restaurant. Good enough to warrant a serious detour. The chef said that he has been working on his creations for twenty years, and we said,'It shows'."
Simply the BEST pizza in London (and maybe the cheapest one). I truly love to go (and come back again and again) to Franco Manca. The Pizza is fantastic and the staff is so lovely.The only weak point is the waiting queue but this is a true sign about the quality of the food!Keep going guys!
For my birthday we went to London for a couple of days and has a treat had lunch on the Hispaniola at the side of the Thames the meal was very good the service was first class. We booked on line and it was 3 courses for £28 each and for London was good and has said no complaints and can recomend.
"The food at Efes is lovely, but it's literally £12 for a kebab - which I think is pretty pricey. Really friendly staff, though!"
they use traditional method of making sandwiches with cheese to melt in indiveidual equities on the grill... great concept however the sandwich combinations not the best..
Service was good. Food however was average. Local reviews were very high but the restaurant did not meet my expectations. :(
"Just had our second lunch take away from Yama Yama in East Finchley & it was gorgeous.Having lived in Japan previously it was so good to find a really authentic independent restaurant, whose food is just as I remember in the outskirts of Kyoto.The staff are so courteous and don't mind explaining to the novice so if you're not sure what to order, don't worry!Also they are well known for their grill section... The teriyaki chicken is excellent."
"Came here yesterday with my brother. We are of Polish heritage so well used to good Polish food. Between us we had the pierogi(filled dumplings) and pickled herring as starters, the veal dish and chicken broth as our main courses. All the food was excellent, particularly the pierogi and the herring. The staff were friendly and attentive. As previous reviewers have said, the cooks serve you your food. We would recommend this place to anyone wishing to give Polish food a try. Will definitley go again when in the area."
"Look at my photo of the plate (it was taken before I started to eat). It was ridiculously small, need to go to Five Guys after that to eat a hamburguet since it is impossible to get satisfied with that. And I am not a big guy. Even my wife was shocked. Totally disapointing. You certainly could spend your money in a better italian restaurant."
"I work just around the corner so I'm lucky that I can pop in whenever I like! The food is always consistently good and the staff are attentive and deal with requests very quickly. This time, we sat at the bar to eat and the barman always made sure we had drinks and was friendly and chatty.Can't fault it here."
"We took our staff out for a well earned Christmas dinner and dance on Saturday, we have a mixture of all ages. We all had a fantastic time, the waiters and waitresses, the bar staff, the food, the manager, the disco were all fabulous and we cant fault anything ! The attention to detail and the atmosphere were fantastic. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and danced the night away, we would definitely book again. Wow, thank you to all the management and staff"
My partner and myself were wandering through the rain in Soho yesterday and stumbled across the Melt room. When we walked in we were given the warmest and friendliest welcome ive received in a long time. I run a restaurant myself and it was a real treat to receive such exceptional service especially as they were close to closing time. The food was amazing. Crunchy crust toastie with a good serving of filling. A big thanks Melt Room!! I will be back and I will most certainly recommend you!
I recommend the steak and as appetizer the escargots. Don't order any fancy wines but stick with the house wine. Tiramisu heavenly.
"Why do I love this place? Truly the sandwiches are wonderful, as are the chips and everything else. It's fast food but so much better than all the rest. I love eating lunch here. The service is great and the food it delicious. I eat at them all over London when I'm there. Forget McDonald's--this is good food."
We pre booked a table in Covent Garden TGI Friday's for our son's birthday being such a busy area didn't want to risk not having a table in the afternoon. Despite being busy on a Saturday afternoon everything about the dining experience was superb. Service from the beginning to end was seamless from refilling drinks to additional order requests and TGI food was served lovely. A lovely dining experience.
"Dated rather than classical; Villa Bianca is charming in many respects but bordering on grubby, especially the upstairs area. Our food was ok though took 40 mins to arrive, service was enthusiastic and did the job. The grand-parents loved it. So good spot for somewhere to take your Nan, otherwise plenty of more contemporary options around which offer a better deal."
"Excellent food and portion size was good. Atmosphere was good and the decor was nice aswell, beer garden was nice iin the summer sun and the grumpy Irish man doing the serving was a delight to meet"
"I like the decor and atmosphere here but unfortunately some of the staff as helpful as they tried to be had a poor grasp of English. The most important thing for me though was the steak. Probably the worst ive had this year and I do love a steak. I mentioned this to the waiter who, due to poor English I assume, laughed. Usually I'd ask to see the manager etc etc but we were late for a show. That said the beer was good the chips were very tasty and my wife's meal she said was lovely (not steak) so not a complete disaster. We shall go again next time there's a show but I won't be having the steak."
"I went here to meet my boyfriend after work for drink. There is a great lager and ale selection and for London, affordable prices. The pub is split in two with a road in the middle and it actually looks great. There is a seating area but also lots of places to sit on the grass around the area. Very easy to get to, right next to Euston station and a small walk from Euston Square. Would recommend if you need somewhere for a quick drink when waiting for a train or just to meet a pal."
"Went for Sunday lunch with our son after telling him how magic it was following two previous visits. The staff are lovely and the ambience and decor very special, but food standards have slipped. I had spiced cauliflower soup with toasted almonds, only one flaked almond and it tasted like thick water that cauliflower had been boiled in, no spice!Water on the table was warm london water, better when I asked for ice, the White wine was also warm. The men had smoked haddock and leek and potato soup which was nice, but not special.I then had roast silverside of beef, which I couldn't slice never. Mind chew, the roast potatoes were huge and solid, the dauphinose potatoes were good and the broccoli was lovely but 4.50 extra. The men shared the roast rib which was ok but huge doughy soft Yorkshire puddings.Overall at £80 a head for a poor Sunday lunch, with wine, it was very disappointing, will not return.If you want to go for the experience, stick to two starters that can't be spoilt and hope they warm the plates up!"
"Staying locally and so decided to visit the Eight Bells for a meal. It was a small, friendly place and the menu offered a good range of food. The steak & ale pie with chips was tasty, very filling & well priced. Didn't stay long as the pub started to fill up and get rowdy. Well worth visiting for a really nice meal but go before 8pm!"
This is probably my local restaurant and I'm very glad of it. Having been here a lot over the years I probably enjoy it more than the first time I went here. I find the menu a lot more interesting than a standard Indian and the food is consistently good (with the free spicy prawn crackers an added bonus) and some really interesting veggie options. Whilst the desserts aren't spectacular you don't really expect them to be in a place like this. If the restaurant is busy (which is most of the time) the atmosphere is really good and the staff like to go the extra mile for example bringing out free dessert when it's someones birthday. A real local delight.
"The food was amazing and the staff is super nice! Mattia, Martina and Gigio made our experience incredible! Felt like I was in Italy!!!"
"Very friendly welcome and lovely waitress. The food was great and we would be more than happy to eat there again. I feel I should mention that I had a vegetarian meal and I found I little piece of sausage in the sauce. This didn't bother me at all as I'm not a vegetarian, more like a raging carniveore, but I would imaging it wouldn't be too pleasant for a veggie to find it in their meal. They were most apologetic. Don't let it out you off."
Before going to a show in the West End we had a great meal at the Carvery and Grill.The roast beef the veggies and the Yorkshire pudding were just great. It felt like Sunday.We finished with a double espresso. Next time when we will be back in London we will return.
"Great food, lovely service and amazing cocktails!! Could have spent hours there, love the decor there. Would recommend the Texan Iced Tea!"
"Went with a friend for the vintage afternoon tea with free flowing champagne. Sandwiches were tasty, the scones were lovely and fresh and still warm. The cakes were also delicious and nice and fresh. I wrongly assumed that they would be a bit tight with the champagne but actually we had more than enough. What stood out for me most though was the fabulous service we recieved, nothing was too much trouble and the minute our glass was empty someone came along and topped it up. Excellent value for money and would definitely return."
"I usually go to another more expensive sushi restaurant, but this is just as good and about half the price. The fish tastes really fresh and good quality. The service is good too. ive been there three times now and haven't had a bad experience. The chefs and the waitresses seem happy to help - I felt taken care of. The have grilled food there too which I haven't tried, but it sounds good. The menu isn't as big as some sushi places but there is good variety."
"Good service, food brought to the table quickly. Tasty especially the fries. Kids loved it. Colouring for them"
"Visiting this place was on the top of my to do list and my partner and I visted there earlier today. What can I say, friendly staff and great tasting healthy food, we were very impressed and will be visiting again very soon."
"Comfortable enough surroundings and after pounding the streets I was glad of the sit down, but oh dear, sandwiches dry and verging on stale, scones which appeared to have been warmed in a microwave as the bottoms had toughened, and just a small pot of tea with no additional hot water. The cream was nice, and the price leaves other afternoon teas standing, Would I go again - NO"
I visit every week. I absolutely love this place!Food service all spot on! I do however miss the weird flower teas
"Have been to this Cote and the one in Tunbridge Wells. The one in TW is a little nicer but both are good. Not surprisingly it has a brasserie style feel, menu, service etc. Our waitress was both very friendly and efficient and the difference between a 3/5 and a 4/5. The food was OK not great. The wine selection was very good and reasonably priced for London. It's not for a special occasion but more for a relaxed lunch or dinner."
"I went on Saturday ordered haddock and chips was told it will take 7min (why 7min I was the only persone at the Q (2:40pm))I waited about 15 min , when I got the fish it was horrible I could not believe it was not fresh and I know the taste of fresh haddock, the chips were very oily .I didn't complain at the time because the would say all our fish is fresh .I will never go back again."
"I came here for a meal with a friend after work. We had a number of sharing plates though you can have main dishes as well. I like interesting new food and I wasn't disappointed - gull egg, sweatbreads etc. Service was friendly and helpful too. Highly recommended."
We have been to this restaurant a dozen times or more. It has a remarkable wine list for a local restaurant. It is warm and friendly with excellent service. It's as near to a continental bar as you can expect to find in London. Brilliant.
The food is quite nice....superb plus the shop floor is so tidy & clean. Great staff I would recommend this place if you are looking a Japanese food for a change
"A restaurant with a wonderful atmosphere! We loved the new look Stuzzico and ........... the food - fabulous. We had a sharing plates of melt in the mouth salamis and wonderful Italian cheeses. Then sea bass and turbot followed. The zucchini was served match stick size, crispy and in Southern Italian red pottery bowls. Well done, Lucca and your team!"
"I booked Polpo in Smithfield for my birthday meal after hearing good things from colleagues. On arriveal (Late lunch on a Saturday). I was informed that there was a power cut, and the restaurant would be unable to cater for my group. The manager apologized, but rather than just leaving it at that, (and leaving me high and dry, with nowhere for me and my 8 guests to eat). He very kindly, ran around to all the local restaurants to see if they would be able to cater for my group. As that proved unsuccessful, he phoned the Covent Garden branch, who made a special exception to fit us in. I'm glad they did, the food was delicious, the atmosphere laid back, and the staff equally as friendly. Would definitely revisit in the future."
"Arrived and I was seated very quickly, the menu was given to me and the server disappeared.About 5 minutes later she came and asked if I wanted a drink!The table was still a little dirty from the last people that had used it!She came back and took my food order, with what I ordered she never confirmed if I wanted noodles, white rice or brown rice. The food Arrived quickly and was very nice. I asked for a fork which took 15 minutes to come to me, there where no condiments on the table, I waited 5 minutes for the bill considering the venue wasn't overly busy.Not he best one of the chain ive been too."
"We visited late last month, on a very busy Friday, about 20 minute wait for our group of 5. We were brought menus immediately and were given some very good recommendations for food and drink. The food Arrived quickly and was delicious. As we we're in a group we got to taste multiple dishes, all were perfectly seasoned and cooked. We each paid around £30 for food and drinks and even had food to take away, the portions were generous. We had a lovely server and returned less than a week later. Would highly recommend."
"This is luxury fine dining at its best. We sat in a room with 2 other couples, an open fire and lovely atmosphere. It was so romantic. The food was to die for. i enjoyed a crab and lobster bisque to start and my fiance and i shared the smoked pork for our main. and although we couldnt fit in dessert, they bought out some petit fours for us to enjoy afterward. The staff recommended which wines we should have with dishes we ordered, and even when we chose a different wine (due to the price tag) they gave us each a glass of their chosen wine for free. The waiter showed us the amazing conservatory afterwards and gave us a full history of Clos Maggiore. Its isnt cheap, but is one of the most romantic and memorable birthdays that i will cherish forever."
"Fast service, wide choice on menu, food was very nice, busy so quite noisy. Never used the toilets. Be prepared to share a table with others."
Have been a few times and each time it gets better. Which is why we keep returning. Tonight was no exception. Rosie helped us at our table and was super attentive even thought it was busy. Paulo TheHusky was made to feel really welcome as usual. Other patrons also seemed to really like having a canine presence. I think it might be the area where it is situated. A genuinely dog friendly neighbourhood. Have not even started to praise the food. Always perfectly balanced and served. Thank you to the whole team for a really good evening.
Really! Restaurant wasn't busy but still my food Arrived cold. It doesn't matter how delicious it may be. The fact that it had to be sent back. Service not to good either. I never pay any service charge that is added
"It's getting to the point I can't go through Kings Cross without getting some sushi. Excellent price, good quality and so much healthier than the normal alternative 'grab and go' options around. Well worth a try is you're passing.It's even inspired me to try to make sushi at home (they don't deliver to my postcode... which is probably a good thing)."
"This charming little restaurant is more of Japan than the west,certainly not commercial. It is small minimalistic space with an open kitchen facing on to the dining area where you can see the master chefs preparing each course from the fixed menus .There are three levels £60,£80 and £100 which offers an increasing number of courses all beautifully presented and delicious. This is not a cheap night out but certainly worth every penny for the quality and authentic experience similar to that experienced by us when visiting Japan.There is little to fault but do not expect european styled Japanese cuisine this is the real deal."
This is a truly Spanish tapas restaurant! All the staff is Spanish the food is fresh and authentic plus taste great. I will definitely go back for more!!!
"Have been using the Indigo Restaurant for several years. It feels like home, the staff know you by name, greet you courteously and in a friendly manner. The menu is comfortable. And so are the wine prices. Excellent ambiance for business or pleasure as long as you avoid matinee day and The Lion King next door !"
Small cafe area at the back of the Wardour Street shop is a great place for a quick plate of good Spanish ham & a glass or two of rioja. Pleasant service and a great selection of ham & sausage to tempt you on the way out.
"We had food last year with friends and has a brilliant time, took my stepdad out for the day to London decided to eat here as it was so good last time. Well this time was a complete disappointment.......staff not interested in customers more interested in chatting and talking amongst themselves! Staters were delicious wine perfect, we ordered burgers.....dry with what looked like and tasted off ""rainbow slaw"" said it came with cheddar but was actually a blue cheese, not a problem me and my step dad like blue cheese my girlfriend however does not! Leaving her already dry burger even dryer!! When the check on our meals happened we had almost finished!! We ordered puddings I decided on the cheese plate... Big mistake... More Apple than cheese only 2 types of cheese neither that amazing with some ""crisp bread"" crisp was an understatement! And I'm not sure why but was given a fork to eat my cheese plate with!! No knife the others enjoyed their puddings. While we were sitting eating one member of staff helped himself to some bread and butter from the kitchen (not a problem) but to then wipe the excess butter off his fingers on the butter dish well this is a problem. Poor food hygiene!!! Vile, paid bill and left, only server taking our payment said thank you and good bye on the way out we walked past at least 5 members of staff no one said good bye or thank you. Not one never of staff seemed happy talking to customers all to wrapped up chatting amongst themselves."
The service was good with people taking care of you with short waiting time. The atmosphere is pretty nice and the restaurant well decorated. As a desert definitely take the chocolate and caramel cake which is really good. I recommend this place
"This is the third time ive been and the third wonderful experience. Tom went out of his way to ensure I was well fed, even though I was late (although I wouldn't advise turning up late!). He rightly gets a lot of credit, but is backed up by a great staff, including Stephen, the Frenchman who acts as the quiet man in the double act. Beautiful homely pies and great home-cooked desserts. My favourite restaurant in London."
"We are regulars due to the consistently tasty food and lovely service. Pizzas are thin and crispy and the pasta properly cooked. If you are looking for a quiet, romantic Italian this is not the right place. Buona Sera is always bustling. It's great value for Northcote Road. Highly recommend."
Superb place with a great selection of beers and ciders all in good nick. Snack needed on a boozy day out and had a scotch egg......lovely best one I have ever had.
We visited London for my birthday and went out for dinner here. It was very busy - being a Friday night - but we were served very quickly and the food was delicious. The only thing I didn't like was such a high service charge.
"I suggest everyone to try the ""benedit eggs"", boiled chicken sandwich and fresh fruit drinks. Friendly and kind staff."
Very good customer service with nice staff and very good quality food. We were felling like at home with very nice atmosphere .
"I booked in for my staff Christmas for 10 people a month before the event and booked the side/priveate room. We had a conversation about how important it was for us to have the side room and asked for it to be noted in the booking form. The day before the meal I called them to confirm the booking.When we Arrived, there were people in the room we booked and they claimed no record of our booking. The waitress actually said that we couldn't have made the booking because she was working that day. When I showed her the call on my phone, she maintained that I couldn't have made the booking and became very surly.We were finally offered a seat in the basement and when I suggested a free bottle of prosecco to make up for it, it was ignored. The waitress finally relented when we complained again.I wouldn't mind as much if the same thing hadn't happened the year before (although on that occasion they moved the others from the room).The food is fine and reasonable value and the location is good but the service is totally unreliable and surly. Almost ruined our meal and we will go somewhere else next year."
"We decided to take lunch here on a busy Saturday, but were soon seated. Our orders were quickly taken and the food soon followed the drinks we had requested.I ordered the chicken Caesar salad and was given a salmon Caesar salad, which I queried. The waiter offered to replace the meal immediately and I said that it was OK as I was happy with the Salmon. He returned later and confirmed that I had ordered the chicken and that the mistake was theirs, which he didn't need to have done as I had already accepted the meal.We ordered desserts and teas, which were delivered with the explanation that there would be no charge for these as the manager wanted to make amends for their mistake and for us to be happy with our visit.The bill came and indeed we were not charged for those items.Mistakes happen, it is how they are dealt with that matters and the staff and service at this restaurant are great in delivering an enjoyable dining experience.As an aside to all this, the food was excellent!"
"This restaurant, I believe, is related to the Frankie & Benny's chain as it had the same menu. Not sure whether the prices are exactly the same. The location of this restaurant is ideal if you're in the centre of London, as it's opposite Trafalgar Square.Given this prime position, it was very disappointing that the service levels were so poor.We went in here by accident - it was pouring with rain and we needed a place of refuge. It appeared that many others had the same idea. We weren't shown a table in any kind of decent manner - the waitress walked ahead of us, dumped the menus on the table and continued walking towards the kitchen. This was pretty rude.Restaurant itself is very small and crowded - more a cafe size with too many tables and chairs cramped into a small area.Drinks orders took a long time to arrive, as did the time to actually place the food order and receive the food - which, unfortunately, we'd grown to expect from the Frankie&Benny chain.My friends had burgers and they said it was really great. I had pizza - not so great. Tomatoes were sour, cheese was terrible (very cheap, processed kind) and pizza base was dry and overcooked.Toilet facilities are downstairs - feels like walking into a dungeon. It's quiet and slightly scary if you're going down there by yourself. But at least there are some nice classic baseball pictures on the walls on the way down. Toilet cubicle was ridiculously small - I had to squeeze into the corner in order to open the door as the door swung open to exactly where the toilet bowl ended.In the time that I was away, another friend had asked the waitress to bring us the bill. By the time I got back to the table, it had still not Arrived, and we waited another 10 minutes. I turned to find the waitress - she was cleaning the kitchen instead. I walked to the barman and asked him to arrange for our bill to be sent. He told me to ask the waitress. I told him that I had, and showed him that she was working in the kitchen just behind him. Then he shrugged his shoulders and continued working. Eventually, she came over with the bill and asked whether we would like to leave a tip!!Yes, here's a tip - go back to waitressing school.The service at this restaurant is terrible. I will never spend another penny on the overpriced food at this establishment."
We just came across this restaurant when looking for something to eat and £12.95 for two courses was good value. The atmosphere and service were very good.
"Since our last visit the good folks at 68 and Boston have been hard at work making changes to the upstairs cocktail bar, Boston. I am delighted to say that they are all for the better.The cocktail list has been revamped, keeping their original and tempting wine-based libations but it also showcases their excellent command of the classics. You are in very safe hands here.Best of all though the seating has been improved. Gone are the high stools and bench tables. In come comfy chairs and sofas. All much more relaxed and lounge-like.So now with top-notch drinks, cosy seats, great service, and reasonable prices, what's not to like?"
Visited with family. Arrived early and therefore easy to get a table. Good service and nice food. Plenty of choice of restaurants in the immediate vicinity.
"Usual Giraffe fayre. Cooked well. Service friendly but a noisy kitchen with heated argument going on. Saw, through the 'dirty plate return window' , 2 kitchen staff having a push and shove argument. Lacking professionalism. Went elsewhere for puds."
This incredibly cute restaurant offers a romantic and cozy athmosper alongside the most delicious food in Shoreditch. We came here for Valentine's Day and the whole night has been a dream!
This was a great place to go for a meal.We were shown to a table of our choice as we Arrived early.Promptly offered drinks and shown the A La Carte and the Special menus. We all ordered from the Specials Menu which offered a good variety of Starters and Mains.We only went for the 2 courses which was about £12 superb value.Food was delicious - hot - and served quickly and efficiently.Would recomend booking if you want to got there as by the time we were about to leave at 6.45 the Restaurant was full up not a table to spare.
Had lunch there and to celebrate daughter's birthday. We were not let down by the quality of food and service. Not cheap but worth the experience. They even present my daughter with a desert mochi ice cream...nice touch from Nobu!
"We went with fish and chips because, when you land in London that is what you do. Lots of beers that I have never known were there to try. Service delightful. Easy access to the Marriott next door. Read the menu and you'll learn that this is part of a chain and if you log onto their website you can claim 5 pounds off your next visit - which might come later in the day as they have several pubs. You will have to climb lots of stairs to use the Lou so plan your day."
"We had a celebration birthday dinner at Tredwell's on September 14. We started with cocktails, a KettleOne Vodka martini and a Grey Goose Cosmopolitan, both perfectly prepared. For appetizers we enjoyed tomato soup and Pawns, both delicious. For our entrees we had Salmon, corn fed Chicken with a side of Broccoli accompanied with a bottle of Eberle Chardonnay. The entrees, side dish and the chardonnay wine were all very good. Our waiter, Valentina and the wait staff provided a first class dining experience. An enjoyable evening... we would recommend."
"The setting in the church yard is really quite pretty and unusual. We called for breakfast. The service was good and quick, but the cooked breakfast was average. Handy if you are heading to the Tower of London. Note on Google Maps, the place has a different name - Kitchen at The Tower."
"Went there with friends last week. Expectations were high but easily met and then some. Staff were very friendly and open, service quick and professional. Excellent sommelier giveing great advice and perfect choices when deciding for each guest at the table. We went for the tasting menu with select wines and can absolutely recommend that. The dishes were exquisite, each course outdoing the previous. Cannot express our pleasure strongly enough. A must when visiting London. Thank you so much to all the staff for providing such a memorable evenening."
"We ate here after a long morning sightseeing. The food was ok, portions were ok, service was ok. Just an average meal to be honest. Bathrooms weren't very clean even though the place was very empty (only about 6-7 tables had diners as it was a mid-week lunchtime). OK place to go if you want standard fare with nothing special and you don't need to use the bathroom for anything apart from to wash your hands."
"I was disappointed by Little Frankies. This was my first visit and was keen to go as had heard positive reviews. However this establishment was not up to standards. The toilets were absolutely disgusting! Probably one of the worst toilets ive visited! The food was ok, nothing special and I had to send my drink back as they got it wrong. The waiter gave me a filthy look and was sarcastic which was rude. Overall I was disappointed and won't be visiting again."
"We went there a Friday evening before seeing Lion King. The kids liked it, though the portion of BBQ ribs was very small for our 8 old son and he could have eaten 4 times as much. No kidding as the taste was very good! Dont bother about the strawberry Daiquiri as one cannot taste the alcohol (had my husband trying it and he confirmed it) and when mentioned to waiter, she said that it is normal for such a drink."
"Monday lunchtime. Restaurant filled up quite quickly, so book or arrive around 12.30.Nice service, wine brought to table within 10 minutes and then order taken.I chose from the 'special 2-course' menu - Tuna rillettes which was very good but the main course Minute steak (£2 surcharge) was a most wretched experience. Half a centimetre thick, shaped like an insole, tasteless, truly flavour deficient, cooked in a sous vide .... then a few lines of browning applied. It hadn't been anywhere near a grill or griddle, hence the lack of any flavour.Just ask how they cook their steaks before you order and if it's by sous vide method .... choose something else!"
Treated my family for a mid week meal. Everyone went home full and satisfied. Very tasty food. My jerk chicken was wholesome and everything freshly made. We were made to feel very welcome and we all enjoyed our visit.
"I ate here this evening with my son and his girl friend at the suggestion of a friend. The menu for food to be broadly appealing for a diverse set of interests. The wine list and ability to sample so many wines by the glass was fantastic. The setting was just right ... quality without being stuffy. The staff was excellent -- knowledgeable, courteous, attentive without being intrusive, and flexible."
"Centrally located, friendly staff and a young attractive crowd. The place was busy on a weekday. Good quality steak and burgers and nice wine to go with them. Portion sizes could have been a little more generous, but otherwise a good meal."
"We took the children for lunch and the second star is only for the friendly service and the fact that our seven year old liked his burger. The rest of us thought it was appalling. The burgers were cremated. The shakes were runny and bland. The portions were laughable and everything was cold. Considering there are burger joints everywhere now, I can't believe this place is still in business. I certainly won't be using this particular chain again."
"We booked after reading the restaurant critics review in the Guardian newspaper so expectations were high. The restaurant is ten minutes by cab from Liverpool street so problems in getting there and first impressions are good. A garish outside leads to a refurbished interior (old pub?) with tables squeezed round the room - we had booked for six and were shown to an adequate table with just enough room but this added to the rustic feel and the place was busy with a good buzz, the food menu is one page (although the wine list is 5-6 pages long - why with such a short list of food?) the focus of the menu is fish/seafood and for my non-fish eating friend this meant no starter (shame !) while the rest of us shared perfect oysters, grilled prawns with a perfect lemon mayonnaise, scallop carpaccio and stuffed crab rolls, - all equally delicious, Voignier wine was chosen and went well with the food. For mains we had duck (for two but only one person had it (if that makes sense) my meat eating friend had steak again optioned for two but eaten by him self alone as it was only 500 grams and there was one lamb, one sole dish and two fish stews. The food was excellent and there was lots of tasting of each others dishes - this was washed down with a German Pinot Noir - not quite the right wine for every dish but adequate. Then dessert - apple baignets with some thing else - possibly prunes and a posset, All delicious. And THEN the reason for only 3 stars - the service went to pieces - it was strange (almost weird) but it seemed like the staff thought their job was done so no need to bother anymore, 3 coffees sever when four requested - no milk offered - we had to wave for attention to order a whisky - decidedly odd. So to sum up - without the drop in service 4 stars - portion sizes not massive (but where are they nowadays) but all the food perfectly cooked and presented - informal atmosphere and youngish crowd - we spent approx.. £65 per head but we did push the boat out and I'm sure it could be done for much less. So we say give it a try."
"I dined here with a couple of friends. Our reservation was at 8:00 however, we were made to wait until 8:30. As some of our friends were running late, we just ordered a few starters to share in the beginning and we were surprised to see the waiter making a face. Later on as we were enjoying our main course, we were asked if we have finished, and when we answered that we needed time, the same waiter tutted at us. We were appalled. He also got the orders for the main wrong, and forgot about the drinks we ordered as well. The food is not stunning but what you expect for the price, the service, not. Unpleasant experience."
Food was good; not notable. Service was poor - which is unfortunately what I remember. SLOW. SLOW. We were a party of 8 and we had booked in advance. They just couldn't manage us.
"Excellent service, great food, exactly what you want on a night out.Sadly I didn't get the waitress's name, because she would have deserved a personal mention for the great service she gave."
"I can't go to london without having a moment there!This is a little place where you can't be boring..good music, great cocktails and atmosphere!Just try to come early to have a seat :)"
Bit disappointed with this restaurant - you must reserve a table especially on match days or you will not get in
"It's a big venue so with not many in for breakfast it seemed to lack atmosphere but that's not really a negative comment - it was only breakfast after all. This time I moved away from the 'traditional' brekkie food and went for eggs benedict which was great - extremely good hollandaise. Not that expensive either - 2 eggs, ham, spinach, english muffin, tea and fresh orange juice for under a tenner but obviously the equivealent in that famous global Scottish restaurant is far cheaper but I guess you get what you pay for! Service is thorough and friendly."
"Restaurants in hotels can often lack real quaility-Not the Park Terrace .fantastic cocktails ,fresh varieties of bread and well executed seasonal food makes theis a pleasurable dining experience!"""
Avoid!! We go to frankie and bennys all over the country but this one is awful you can't even sit next to your partner you are crammed next to random people staff seem annoyed if you ask to move food wasn't that nice drinks took 25 minutes was just rammed and I didn't enjoy it at all we paid the bill and left ASAP hated it
I had afternoon tea. Scone was okay but it was clear that cucumber and salmon sandwiches had been made some time ago. I did not try egg and ham sandwiches. Cucumber sandwich was too soggy and a slice of salmon sandwich was too dry (whereas the second salmon sandwich slice was ok in terms of dryness). I did not complain just because I did not want spoil the visit as I was with a friend. Will not visit again. Disappointed.
"Stuzzico has been around for a while but the management has recently changed and there is a new verve to the place.Luca and his team are welcoming and warm, nudging you charmingly to great wine choices. That's all fine and dandy.But when simple yet exquisite pasta and very fine fish dishes really delight in a town completely spoilt for good food, you know you are onto a good thing.We've been dining out in Connaught Village for years. Tonight's meal was infused with the energy derived from talented craftspeople embarking on a new adventure. And the talent shows. Drop in a and enjoy. You'll have a wonderful experience and a great meal to boot."
"Went here for the first time a couple of weeks ago for my nans 80th and food was delicious, loads on the menu to choose from and big portions. The staff were very friendly and polite! A must try :)"
"I booked this restaurant for my boyfriend for our anniversary meal via a Travelzoo voucher (which was excellent value). The venue, ambience, staff and table we were seated at were excellent. The menu had a wide choice (not restricted to a set menu like many offers), and we could each choose a delicious cocktail as part of the deal, three courses and a cheese course. The food was excellent, I had steak and it was cooked perfectly, and the starters were particularly good. Dessert was light and full of flavours.The wines were reasonably priced and we had a wide choice. The hotel the restaurant is attached to was in a great location, and looked very slick. To top off our experience, I had requested in advance that a heart or happy anniversary was written on my boyfriends dessert.....and the chef made two beautiful hearts from caramelised sugar and placed them in our desserts. My sincere thanks to the chef for making such an effort to do this. I will definitely return."
"I had lunch here today with business colleagues and found the place to be greatly over-priced. Food was less than average - the mackerel with tomatoes left a decidedly nasty after-taste ( and lacking the anchovies it was supposed to contain ). When we Arrived, we were just poured water but not asked if we wanted a drink or bread. The waiters were disinterested, too busy being uber-trendy to care about the diner's needs. There were no condiments on the table and when we ordered, those who ordered steaks were not asked how they wanted them - you get what you're given apparently. We were still not asked what we wanted to drink so had to summon the waiter to order some. Even then, he had to come back to check what we had asked him for ( four sodas, how difficult is that? ). At no stage were we asked: is everything OK? Standard for any restaurant. Music was turned up and down at will so drowning out conversation. And the double espresso I ordered was so unlike any coffee I had ever tasted. Awful! And the final bill was almost £100 - for four mains, four sodas and three coffees. Outrageous, bearing in mind the quality of the restaurants surrounding it and the street food also available in this bustling area. Do not go here!!!"
"This was just a thoroughly enjoyable experience! 5 of us went, and the whole thing was great. Super service, nice atmosphere, and delicious drinks. Highly recommend the Dante. They were also completely happy to go of menu for us, as a friend had had a cocktail previously that was no longer on the menu.Just great!"
Dropped in for a quick bite passing through and avoiding the rain. Most places busy as was this one. Quickly seated we managed to order our meal without fuss and soon had some drinks on the table. A slightly open air set up of can get a bit chilly. We had the pizza which was okay and enough for both is us to have a quick lunch. Not as nice as some of the other Jamie Oliver food places but more than ok.
There was an ad which says best burger in London. . So told myself why not give t a try..Ordered two burgers.. the only two they had.. a black angus burger and a classic burger. The ambiance was good .. the prices are on the higher side..The burgers were very Average. . Nothing special about themIf i had the chance to go back id go to Byrons just across the street..
"I have eaten in this restaurant many times and I got so used to such good food. when I go elsewhere, I am never entirely happy with food as I feel it does not measure up.In a way, I feel that my stomach is so used to this excellent food that nothing else will do....Great place. Must be tried..."
"We Arrived on a Sunday night after spending the day walking. We didn't quite understand the hours of pubs on Sundays, so we were surprised they were virtually closing the kitchen in 15 mins at only 6pm or so. There was only one other couple in the restaurant at that time. Others on the street were completely closed; tourists standing outside confused.We promptly ordered our fish and chips from the bar and sat down. Although the pub itself has a bit of a sour smell to it, the food was phenomenal. Best fish and chips with mushy green peas I have ever had. The presentation was also nice on a wooden board with the chips in a little bag. The serving was quite generous and we enjoyed our meal very much.We will be back next time we are in London."
"A great place specializing in some really great pies and traditional sides such as mash and gravy, pies were excellent with lots of filling and an nice crunchy crust!"
"We ate here due to the strength of the reviews, but were greatly disappointed at the food. My fish and chips were flavorless and greasy; the chips may even have been frozen. My wife's pie was better, but still not remarkable. Service was subpar. I imagine this is a nice place to grab a pint--it's an interesting building--but steer clear of the overpriced food."
"After choosing the Park Terrace due to the numerous excellent reviews listed, I was extremely disappointed with my experience.We decided to go early and have a cocktail prior to our meal. We were left for 20 minutes in the bar, despite informing the hostess we had a table booked. I had to prompt the hostess to seat us at our table.The starter was fantastic, cannot be faulted but my main left a lot to be desired. There was the addition of squid on my plate, which was not on the menu. I would not have minded if it wasn't for the fact that the squid was horrendously overcooked and had turned to rubber. The staff in the restaurant were very pleasant and helpful but extremely slow and inattentive. I found this extremely unacceptable since the restaurant was extremely quiet and no way near full. I did enjoy my starter and the staff were lovely but my awful main and the poor service made the whole night a very expensive disappointment. For the cost of the night I would have expected 5* service and food. I do not think that it remotely deserves its extremely high rating on Trip Advisor."
"I'm a bit of a pizza snob but this place ticked all the boxes! The pizzas were yummy! Ambience was fab, loved the (REAL) car on the wall with parking tickets and all. Nice outdoor seating as well. Friendly wait staff. Very reasonable priced food considering the trendiness of Chatsworth Road- pizzas were only £6.50 and were huge! might have been lunch time prices though."
We came for dinner while shopping in the area. It was very busy and a bit slow but the food was really tasty and the staff friendly.
"Makans is one of my favourites. They do a lovely all day breakfast too! Their freshly made menu is great, as is the buffet style food. If you like spicy like me then go for the chicken sambal with veg sides of aubergine and greens. I normally have half rice half noodles just to spice things up! When coming home late from work Makans is my saviour! Very reasonable prices too. Love it."
"My partner and I had taken the opportunity to visit the poppy display at the Tower of London on a Friday evening and I had googled for reatsurants close to the Tower and found Strada which is only a 3 or 4 minute walk from there. We walked through their door at 6:00pm. The restaurant was about half full and we were asked if we had a reservation, replying that we didn't the young lady on the door went away and did some magic (rearranging some tables) and quickly showed us to a table. We were served by a more mature Italian lady who was very friendly and chatty. There didn't seem to be any hurry (indeed, our 2 courses took 2 hours from start to finish) but our order was taken reasonablly quickly. There was a bit of a wait for the starters (a variety of breads and oil and a very tasty shrimp in the shell dish in a garlic and herb sauce) and an even longer wait for the main dish. I had earlier mentioned to my partner that there seemed to be plenty of front of house staff but had to revise that opinion as the evening drew on and more people Arrived. My partner played safe with a Margaritta Pizza and I had the veal milanese. My partner mentioned that her pizza had a unique (but nice) taste and on sampling I found the tomatoes in the pizza had been prepared in a different way to that normally found on a Margaritta. My veal was also very nice with roast potatoes and salad. It took a while to get the bill and even longer to pay it. In the end the (very efficient) front of house lady noticed we were waiting and brought the credit card machine over to us (by this time our waitress was clearly under a bit of pressure). There is a growing practise for restaurants to suggest 'following the instructions' on the payment machine. This inevitably means do you want to add a gratuity. I always refuse as this payment, whilst ultimately going to the staff, is subject to tax and delayed for several weeks so I prefer to tip by cash. This usually means I get a reproachful look from the waiter/waitress but console myself with the hope that this would change after I had left when the waiter/waitress found the cash tip on my table.As I said earlier, a little longer than we would have ordinarily liked however we were in no real hurry. Afterwards we wandered across the promenade in front of the restaurant which overlooks the river (as you would expect as we were at St Katherines Dock) and looked at the boats tied up at the mini marina in front of the restaurant.Overall I liked the place and was impressed by the front of house lady who was only in her mid twenties but was clearly totally on top of her role, missing nothing of what was going on in the restaurant. Price for 2 courses with a beer and a soft drink was (for London) a fairly reasonable £44 - I would certainly go again."
Came here for my wife's birthday with family and friends-last came here about 20 years ago maybe more-hasn't changed. The food and service was decent enough-well cooked english fare-recommend the pies and puds-what took the edge off were the eye watering drinks prices -£12 for a glass of prosecco....please! A third of the bill was on drinks and we only had 2 bottles for 6 people-I know Rules arent alone in doing this but you just come out feeling ripped off.Expect a wait saturday night even if booked.
When going to London for a show matinee we usually call into Paul's for a light lunch as we eat our main meal after the show. As usual the food was very good as was the service. Would definitely recommend if you need something to keep you going until dinner time. We had 2 baguettes with fries and salad and 2 coffees which was only £20 - very good prices for London. Would highly recommend if you need to fuel up before more wandering around.
Took advantage of a £59 deal for two based on the standard £102 price point3 courses plus cheese to share and a glass of wine or cocktail eachsetting is pleasant - waiting staff are excellent: attentive but not over the topchoice was from a la carte menu and selection was very goodhighly recommend their starter take on carpaccio of beef and the lamb mains: the pork mains also well received: the cheesecake ensemble was the preferred dessert option and the cheese was very good all accompanied by a good riojaAppreciated that for the first time in ages we were offered bread within the meal deal which is becoming very rare Would return for a special occasion
A lovely venue with prompt friendly service. A range of options including salads and gluten free options. Also gluten free beer. Perfect for everyone!
Nice tasty kerala food for moderate price...!! customer Service is excellent from Mr. Jose. It was a nice experience
"I read many oppinions on this place before going, they were mixed, but the majority expressed how polite and friendly the staff were,and how good the food was . I totaly agree. Very good friendly service, very tasty food, and ample servings as well. The servings are so large just 2 courses in hind site would suffice. Not overpriced at all,very reasonable. Will be going back for sure."
"I took my wife to The Park Terrace restaurant for her birthday after shopping in London during the day and what a fantastic meal we both had. I purchased vouchers from Travelzoo which were nearly half the price but the quality of the food is well worth the full price. The waiters are very informative as the all meals on the menu as theyhave to taste them all so ask any question you like. Another good point is you are never rushed if you want time between courses just ask and the waiters do not hang around making you feel uncomfortable. Our meal was a 3 course with Neals Yard cheese Board and petit fors and not forgetting the cocktails. I would recomend to anybody who likes good well prepared food and service to match.Returned again on 21/04/15 with our 2 daughters quality of service and food still outstanding and well worth the second attendance, go on try it you will not be dissappointed."
"Lovely place, relaxed atmosphere and great service; packed out with great books. Really enjoyed my meal: dahl, red and white quinoa, green salad with 'love"" dressing, beetroot apple and carrot salad and a chocolate Sundae! All for £11.45. Excellent value."
"Wonderful food, great service. Second visit to this restaurant and again a great meal in a lovely setting looking out on to the river Thames."
"Nothing fantastic, but you're sure to find something you like in an interestingly put together concoction of a sandwich. Quick and easy and they're everywhere."
"Worth a visit just for the decor. They say it is London's oldest restaurant. The menu is a comprehensive guide to old English cuisine. Not a noodle in sight! Staff were friendly but it would have been great for my guests from Austria if the whole experience had been very English not just the menu.Service was a little slow but the food was very good. However the main dishes were served without the side orders, I had gorged on half my steak and kidney pudding before the new potatoes Arrived. My colleague had devoured most of his steak before the chips Arrived. Incidently my not very english waiter rebuked me for asking where the 'fries' were. They were in fact very late 'chips'.Be warned it is not a cheap place,but at the prices charged one would expect a more joined up eating experience."
This was our final stop after a day in London for a friend's 50th birthday. The selection of beers on offer was great and we all sampled a variety. Loved the Spitalfields and the Scotch Eggs are to die for!! Definitely recommend this place :)
Amazing and friendly service provided Borys and Lukasz. Delicious food! I would highly recommend this place !
"We had a most enjoyable meal at this restaurant. It was especially memorable because of the delightful waitress, Lina, who was very charming, bright, amusing and efficient."
"Went to the takeaway with my kids, expecting to show them first hand what fish and chips is all about. The fish could have been worse. It was nice and crisp on the outside but kind of flavorless. The chips were just terrible. In all honesty we probably would have been better off eating at McDonalds."
"Paid a visit on a Sunday morning prior to a Arsenal match, ordered Breakfast as soon as we Arrived while it was relatively quiet, an hour later we started to enquire where the food was and the staff admittedly busy could not answer. My friend and i were about to leave when the food Arrived, a miserable apology for a Breakfast it was, cold, overcooked and virtually inedible. My advice, if it's a match day avoid the food at all costs."
First impressions seem quite nice but when I ordered a drink I was given the wrong drink. Then no 'last orders' was announced and when I went to order another drink I was very abruptly told that they had stopped serving. Some manners wouldn't cost anything.
"I visited here for the first time on Friday night with some friends. It was recommended that we book a table and although we only contacted them mid-afternoon on the day we were able to secure a booking for 3. I'm so glad we did because it soon fills up. Although allocated the table for 90minutes, we stayed much longer and at no point were made to feel like we should give the table up.I love the concept of this place. Good wine all at £20. With so many places marking up a bottle of wine to outlandish prices this is a definite gem in the middle of busy Soho. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful making recommendations on the wine and ensuring we had everything we needed throughout the evening.I would highly recommend this place."
"Ibleo at first glance does not offer trendy contempory decor or staff in ubiquitous black trousers , white shirts, piped funky music .. It's not a chain, it's a true one off.Yes in all honesty they could give it a lick of paint, but it's all part of the charm. For Antonio, it's obviously all about the fresh ingredientsVery welcoming, laid back character , larger than life :)Huge variety on menu , great pizzas , lovely pizzas , and as other reviewers have said, fresh steaks and fish.He has cooked specials for us as well..Just try it, sure you wouldn't be disappointed . Prices are fair, with best wine only £35"
"My mum knew of Rules through Barbara Taylor-Bradford's novels and more recently from Downton. Having eaten here with friends for a special occasion I thought it would be wonderful to take mum for lunch. We were first seated near the entrance and mum was a bit chilly and no fuss was made of our request to move to a less draughty table. Well mum was thrilled to be able to see the ornate stained glass roof dome, and to be sat next to the photo of the Queen and Prince Phillip dining at Rules. A perfect start which just got better! Service, wine and the food was fabulous and we thoroughly enjoyed our delicious meal. It's a wonderful place to enjoy a grand sense of occasion in an old time traditional way."
"We thought the food was amazing. My husband loved the Dhaba Murgh with a three cheese naan and will have difficulty being tempted to try something else when we return. I thought the goat curry was wonderful; flavourful soft meat in a beautifully balanced sauce which were well complemented by the recommended lacy rice pancakes. We both enjoyed our mixed selection of starters and the Rose and pistachio kulfi for dessert was beautiful. Staff were friendly, regularly checked on us and kept drinks topped up if required. As to cost, yes it isn't a cheap night out, but then again this isn't your local Indian restaurant either and it is definitely comparable in price to a lot of other reputable restaurants in the area. Our bill was about £60 per head for 3 lovely courses, minus any alcohol. Thank you very much La Porte des Indes for a lovely experience."
The restaurant decor was beautiful with crisp white table cloths and gold ribbons wrapped around the napkins.We ordered kebabs from the extensive menu. The service was friendly and attentive with complimentary olives and bread. The portions were generous and the food was delicious. The food was presented in huge gold turines which added drama to the occasion. The restaurant was not too noisy on a Friday evening.I will certainly visit this restaurant again What a great find!
"Went to here today by accident!! Went somewhere else first, but waited over an hour for our food, and the fella forgot to order our food!So being very hungry and agitated, we had to wait a couple of minutes to get in!! WELL I'm so glad we never got our grub at the other place!!!Staff were excellent, very friendly and fast!Food was absolutely ""PUKKA"" and price was very reasonable!! Can't wait to go back"
"Our experience of the service was excellent: friendly, helpful staff, who were able to explain clearly and fully about the menu, and all the oyster choices. We were impressed. Three of our party had the oysters and said they were great. They'd chosen which ones to have on the basis of the descriptions from the server and they were spot on. A small criticism would have been that the steak left the party quite early on, which was a shame, but there was a lamb dish and the fish dishes were great - the sea bream was pretty spectacular. Presentation could possibly be improved with the starters: the tuna carpaccio was a pretty unattractive heap and the crab scone was, well, a scone with crab meat in the middle; a bit dry, if quite tasty. But, overall, we enjoyed the meal, the service and the ambiance. Organic wines were good, as well."
I had dinner recently at Tramshed with some friends. The atmosphere is great and buzzing and the decor very of the moment. The service was very good and attentive. We tried to Bull Shots as an aperitif and they were very nice. We had a selection of good starters to share and the Porterhouse for main course which was perfectly cooked. The deserts were also very good. Some may think the menu is limited (steak or chicken for main) but when everything is done as well as we experienced that really doesn't matter. I will be returning soon.
"We sat at the counter which is nice as you can see the chefs at work but also smokey when they sear the beef. Restaurant is small but very nice, staff super friendly. There are 3 set menus all serving Kobe beef, ranging from 60-100£. We went for the 3 course 60£ menu. The first course with all the little dishes was amazing. so beautifully presented and tasty. Then we had the beef which was so good and then sushi which again was fantastic.We were so full, could not have managed another course. Total bill with 2 bottles of water and 3 glasses of wine for 2 came to 174£, so not cheap but very worth it."
"The large sandwiches are indeed that: one-and-a-half, and lots of meat for £13. The tongue was tasty but too salty. The gherkin was good, but a bit sweet for a New Yorker's taste."
"Tootoomoo has a wide range of dishes and a fantastic selection for all dietary requirements. They serve a mixture of sizes of plates and there really is something for everyone on the menu. We had a very enjoyable lunch- the restaurant has a fresh, relaxed atmosphere and the staff were fantastic. Highly recommended!"
"We came up for the weekend with friends and booked Rules as we hadn't been there for over twenty years, so was a bit apprehensive, however once inside, it felt like we hadn't been away, very little had changed, in a good way!, apart from the prices ha ha!Our friends hadn't been before, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience as did we, although expensive, would recommend it to other for a special occasion, we only had one course each, a pre dinner G&T , two bottles of wine and three coffees, £308 later, we left."
"Home cooking at it's very best. The portions are huge. The menu traditional and delicious. Tom must be the friendliest, most gregarious host there is. A great atmosphere whether dining in the quaint restaurant or the traditional south London pub. Within 10 minutes walk you can find any number of establishments who will charge you twice as much for half the portion and half the quality. Always my first port of call when I work in London. I cannot recommend it highly enough."
"Fab cocktails and a veg burger to die for! Nice atmosphere, great location if you want to go out afterwards. Great way to start off your Friday nights!"
Went in before going to Memphis the musical. Wanted to try some local ales and the bar staff offered me a taste of a couple so I could choose nice touch well done. Very friendly and busy pub. Great atmosphere
"This restaurant has really gone down from a few years ago when there was a very good Chef. The food was not great, only the sea bream. The service was terrible. The young guys looked and walked like zombies and like they did not care. My son had no forks on his setting and nobody brought any after bringing the food. He asked three times and made a remark on it. Also when we ordered dessert no spoons were brought and we had to ask for that too. There was mess under the table near us which my son took a picture of and could have been swept up, as they were not that busy. The fish jugs are really a silly feature and difficult to pour the water out of. They also had run out of the chocolate pot even though it was not busy. The toilets also could do with upgrading. My daughter was told on the phone there was a set menu brunch but they said there was not. In the end they brought a set menu carte which we ordered from. Needs more clarifying on the Website and maybe they were not happy that we did not take a la carte. Very poor for a restaurant that is not cheap and in a good area. Don't think we will be going back there unless there is gross improvement especially in service and food also."
"I visited Rosa's for a third time recently and plan to revisit as much as I possibly can as the food is outstanding. My partner and I love this place. The food is wonderful, definitely the best veggie green curry I have tasted (and I have had far too many to count) and the staff are so friendly and welcoming - they even remembered us from the last time we came which had been a few weeks earlier. We are both vegans and my partner is gluten free, so we are over the moon that Rosa's has taken the time to make a separate Veggie Menu and also a Gluten Free Menu. All of the food was prepared to perfection. We had the summer rolls which were delicious with a fantastic sauce. The green curry was simply the best ive tasted and the chefs were not shy in adding plenty of chillies which is just how I like it. Portions are generous and my only regret was not having enough room for dessert!I can also highly recommend the coconut water and blue vodka cocktail. It's refreshing with just the right amount of vodka kick. Rosa's team were all very friendly and all remained upbeat and smiling even though the restaurant was very busy. Do try to book at busy times though otherwise you may be disappointed. All in all a great experience. I even had dreams about the green curry days afterwards, that's how delicious it was! Congratulations Rosa's on a wonderful dining experience and see you again soon."
"My friend and I just start our gastronomic trip in Europe with this restaurant, We totally enjoyed the place. The food was delicious; the service great, and the atmosphere was lovely. Everything from the bread and butter, to the staff's knowledge of the wine list, to the simple decor of the restaurant were spot on. Thanks !"
"Strolling round Covent Garden at 2pm last Wednesday afternoon looking for somewhere to eat and had a nosey at what was on plates being eaten. Looked tasty, good size portions and plenty of customers. We didn't have to queue. Having seen the portion sizes we opted to share a Margaret pizza with a coleslaw salad and 2 bottles of cider. Pizza was very good and the coleslaw was just heaven. The prices for food are reasonable particularly as nobody minds you sharing but the wine is a little on the expensive side. Hence we chose a 500ml apple and a 500ml pear cider served over ice in a half pint mug for £5 each. A really good cider and very refreshing. There's really no need to spend £8 on a glass of pimms (previous contributor take note). The downside were the toilets. Could do better on this score I think. We are in London for the finish of the UK bit of the Tour de France so we are looking forward to going back to Union Jacks again before we go home."
"Union Jacks is a good option for something tasty in Covent Garden area. The menu has various classics on it and some nice seasonal specials - roast chicken with asparagus and pesto was a good example of this. It's a reliable option, though didn't blow my socks off. The heated seats and heating for your 'toes' is a great idea as it can be a chilly spot to sit, and this means your food gets cold fast. So do try and sit on one of the outside counters to make maximum benefit of this."
"We always head to this TGI's when in London, because of it's location a little off the beaten track of Covent Garden it's always less busy than Leicester Square's hustle & bustle which I much prefer. The food is always good, the staff and Management aim to please and have always do well. I highly recommend :)"
"I would have given this restaurant an ""Excellent"" rating if we did not have to wait one hour for the starter and another 45 minutes for the main meal. The 2 waitresses were very friendly and helpful and the food was excellent. We had dinner here last July and had the same slow arriveal of the food. We came back with friends this week hoping to experience a faster service but we were very disappointed. We will not come back until we read a good review about the service. Hiring another good chef will do the job."
Nice flavours and fresh food. Porridge is convenient.
"Oh what a shame! I know these restaurants have been around for years, but this was my first time visiting. Had great recommendations about the food, but wasn't told about 'that one thing'.The service was very good, there were no 'hidden' service charge and I was happy to leave a tip (which is unusual for me). Both waiters were quick, helpful, attentive, friendly and knowledgable. Things were looking good.The food was very good: my burger and chips/fries were lovely and my son loves the rack of ribs. Great food.0-Then it came ... another customer had a birthday ... all the waiting staff gathered around them and sang, very loudly around them and next to us. This was too much for me.Too American for me."
I couldn't believe how lovely Christmas lunch was - ample to drink plus a 3 course meal for 16. Everyone enjoyed their food and a three course meal for under £30 in an amazing part of town. It all Arrived on time and no mistakes with orders either. A well hidden offer in a beautifully decadent hotel/ restaurant - am sure we will be back
We visited the restaurant because we had an offer voucher for a 3 course dinner with cocktail for £31.70 each.We had a fantastic meal with exceptionally good service.Being able to choose from the full menu was unusual for such an offer and the choice was excellent. I particularly enjoyed the beef fillet starter and my main course of sea bass. The service from our waitress (I'm afraid I didn't find out her name) was exceptional.The restaurant was relaxing and conducive to easy conversation amongst 6 people.We received 2 more vouchers as we left and will certainly be visiting again for our pre-Christmas get together.
"We visited on a Monday around 5pm, so it was busy as expected though not packed. I was constantly getting bumped and nudged by staff and customers squeezing through the narrow channel between my chair and the chair of the lady behind me. Not really conducive to a relaxing dinner.We had a Jack Daniels Tower as a shared starter, which was nice enough. Our mains and drinks took a long time to arrive. The burgers were thick but a bit dry. We asked our waiter for ketchup but it never materialised so we gave up waiting. On the plus side, my Purple Rain cocktail was lovely.Obviously they were busy hence the slow service and forgetfulness, but I didn't enjoy dinner that much. I'd recommend coming during a quieter period."
"The best thing about this place is the valet parking and all the associated staff - doormen, reception, etc. Otherwise, take everything that grates about London and you will find it either on the dance floor or one of the maze-like warrens of this hideous cave. Very cramped conditions, very mediocre food. They say the clientele makes a club. Well, if you like arrogant, rude, poncy, pushy, self-absorbed, this is the place for you. And you can do it all to poor dance music. And definitely not for claustrophobes either."
We have had a truly nice time with our waiter who served us the nice recipes from delicious Jamie Oliver food with lots of joy and skill. Thanks again.
"Would recommend this restaurant when you are in the area! Atmosphere is splendid with the owner greeting and involved in each dinner served. Our pasta was delicious. Made to order and prepared perfectly. Pasta was el dente and the sauce was just like mama's! Very nice dining experience with an affordable price! From wine to dessert, our time here was memorable. Oh.... The panna cotta was delicious! Can not come up with a single suggestion!"
"Decided to go here for our annversary. I have been to TGI twice before 1st time amazing second awful. This service was okay. starter good mains were awful, ribs cold husband ate them because he was hungary didnt want to wait for them to redo. i had the cheese burger. i know they season there chips which is fine. but my whole dinner burger chips lettuce all tasted of salt so much so i couldnt eat it. no check back was done so had to wait to grab someone finally they took the meal and offered something else but we were in a hurry. ruined are annversary meal. i will not use tgi again and i reccommend to find somewhere else. its overpriced and under quality."
"This restaurant has been open a number of years and to be honest, I have avoided it because having been to one with my teenage children years ago, the chain must have been in my bottom 10 places to eat.But it is much improved. Whilst I would be very unlikely to go for an evening meal, and could be persuaded to go for lunch, breakfast are first class. I have now been 3 or four times in the lat 6-8 mths and it is quite, the staff are good and as the heading says, the food is good value; the £5 breakfast deal was excellent but the current one is still good"
Had a lovely meal here when working down in the area. Very friendly staff. Lovely fresh well cooked food and all at a competitive and affordable price for the area. Would definitely recommend.
"Always wanted to review this place again. After a bad experience with reservations last year, I have had numerous great experiences in this fabulous place. Not only the staff made it up to me after I was treated unfairly on my first visit, but I enjoyed so much my time at Bush Hall dining rooms that it's now my number 1 brunch place in the area. Scrumptious food, great atmosphere and very good coffee. Definitely recommend!"
"I was quite excited to finally eat here, having wanted to try it for some time.The atmosphere, decor, and service were excellent, and we did enjoy the overall experience. The food wasn't bad, in fact there was nothing really wrong with it, it just wasn't terribly good. For the price charged, it was distinctly average, and this would put me off coming again. On the plus side the wine was excellent and by central London restaurant standards perfectly reasonable in price.I'm pleased we went, and we had a pretty good time, but the food was disappointing - pheasant a bit tough and not terribly tasty, vegetables bland, etc. It suggested complacency, which is a pity. I'll try the restaurant again in the future no doubt, but I was expecting that once I had eaten there I'd be desperate to go back, and sadly that just wasn't the case."
Stay at the Landmark Hotel nearby and have probaby walked over 8 - 12 times in the last 10 years...used to enjoy quality food. This place needs new ownership...what a shame. I never felt I needed to burn my clothes after previous visits. Will someone in the UK press do an updated review? Sorry but the truth should help...I hope.
"I recently celebrated a special birthday with family and friends in the Denbury Room upstairs. From start to finish, we enjoyed a fabulous experience set in a ambient, stylish and relaxed setting. The event was superbly managed by Mary Jane and supported by a very professional, efficient and friendly service team, front and back. The menu was exceptional; wonderful choices, freshly prepared ingredients, cooked to perfection, beautifully presented and delivered on time. I cannot recommend The Truscott Arms highly enough. It's a big 10/10 from me."
"What a find! Cracking drinks menu, service top notch and never waited too long for drinks, which can be an issue with specialist cocktail places in my opinion."
"The food at Bombay Chow is spicey Chinese - a Hakka: a mixture between people coming from China to Bombay. Consequently all the people in the restaurant except for us seemed to be Asian: a good sign. The starters: things like Cauliflower, spicy cheese etc were really well cooked and tasty and next time we go we are just going to have loads of the starters."
Amazing the fish and. Bottomless. Chips every bit was perfect I was going to see a show in the west end. With a friend. And I said. Let's go. And have fish and chips in the. Best plaice. In London. Was. Not. Disappointed. The service was. Good. The fish and chips were. Out of this world very. Nice would. Go again. Top marks .
"This is our first visit to London. On our first night the three of us wanted to go to a TGI,s as we normally love it. This was the closest one to our hotel. The staff were very friendly. My husband and I ordered a bottle of Rose. Husband ordered a coke and daughter a coke too. They forgot a coke plus they informed us there was no bottles of the wine we ordered. We then ordered a bottle of white. Meanwhile our shared starter platter came but we had to ask for plates. On the plus side the starter was very good. No sign of our wine though. The manager then told us they had no bottles of white wine! As my husband does not like red I just ordered a glass of red wine. The Manager said that it was free for the inconvenience. The main courses were quite good and my steak was cooked to perfection. Time for our bill. Imagine our surprise that we had been charged for the 2 bottles of wine that we never got!!!! We pointed this out and of course they were taken off our bill with many apologies. Not impressed at all!!!!"
The hotel has a lovely atmosphere inside but is very expensive with a glass of cider costing 9 pounds 45p. It is in a busy area with a lot of traffic outside.
"Decided to eat at this restaurant and what a good decision it turned out to be! The waiter was fantastic, I can't remember his name but he was extremely friendly and nothing was too much trouble. We had the hommus to start, not huge but really nice and the Duck Stir Fry and Quesadilla, very large portions and well cooked and presented. I would advise that if you are sitting outside to take care of your bag and belongings, it is a bit of a haven for handbag thieves around the market especially when there are tables outside and you might not be on your guard. Having said all that, we would definitely return to this restaurant."
"A friendly, unassuming place to go for a quick bite, a date or even a party. The tapa platters are excellent value for money. Look out for their really good specials! Good house wine. Wow, how lucky to have such a cool place on my doorstep in Honor Oak Park!"
"In 1990 I took my wife to be into Wolfe's on Park Lane. I had no idea that it was a gourmet restaurant. Because of the smell I ordered ""Rack of Lamb"". When the waiter put my plate on the table, I blurted out ""Whoa! I ordered rack of lamb, not rack of mouse. On the plate the rack consisted of 4 of the tiniest chops I have ever seen. Each topped with the even tinier paper crown. 24 years later, I cannot remember how much my bill was, but I still remember the magnificent taste of that meal.. BRAVO ! (Do not send me a gift voucher. I am far too old to travel) Stan Shaw DeLand Florida US"
"If you are looking for a reasonable quick lunch or dinner, Nando's is a safe choice. This restaurant is rather new, in a newly opened shopping/business centre. There are plenty of other fast food chains around, too.Obviously, most is standardized so the one differentiator is service. That was good, even though the restaurant was packed. Food was just as good as you would expect."
"Had lunch here whilst on shopping day in London. Initially couldn't find anything on the menu we fancied but very helpful waitress agreed to swop it around a bit and when the food came it was good. Desert, the chocolate brownie, was the best we had ever tasted. A bit on the pricey side, but it was central London and prime location with good service."
"This was a Travelzoo deal and an amazing experience. Lovely service, amazing cocktail and food included in the deal. No issue with tap water and plenty of bread as required. I would love to come here again if a deal is available as expensive without. My only issue would be the cost of wine but not surprising at such a quality eating establishment. All staff are a credit to the restaurant. Congratulations to the chef too!"
"Booked Afternoon Tea for for for my partner's birthday last Saturday. When we Arrived we handed over our booking confirmation and were shown two booths to choose from, unfortunately both with small circular tables set with side plates for three. After 10-15 minutes we were asked if we'd chosen what we wanted and said again that we were there for Afternoon Tea. Another 10-15 minutes passed before the tea Arrived. The lady poured it out for us and said she'd get us some milk. Yet another 10-15 minutes passed (with our tea getting cold) before my partner went to ask for milk. With the table being so small there was only enough room for the four side plates, four cups and one teapot so before the food Arrived they brought over a small low table and we ended up having to put one tea pot, the milk jug and one stand of food on the table and the person nearest had to keep making the tea for everyone and replenishing the food on the table. The table would have been fine for two, a bit of a squeeze for three but far too small for four. Having said all that, the food was very pleasant (apart from being given a ridiculously small amount of jam!) but the whole experience was very disjointed having to wait for things and having to constantly shuffle things around. Plus the booking mentioned it was a birthday treat but that made absolutely no difference at all."
"After a good 4 hour shop in selfridges, seeing this little cosy stylish gem was a delight. We stopped only for drinks. Clean tidy and friendly staff, cospolitains and beer a delight"
"A very nice restaurant to eat at center London, really close to the Trafalgar square, it offers a nice italian food. The place is very cozy and charming."
"Quick, tasty and just as you want it. Nice and clean, reliable place to eat especially if you need a bit of simple nourishment."
"This was my second visit to The Blue Legume, around midday on a Tuesday and it was busy although the restaurant itself is spacious.I stayed for thirty minutes with just a croissant and macchiato and enjoyed the atmosphere amongst a cross section of customers, particularly mothers with push chairs as the floor space is relatively easy to navigate and the tables spacious.I made a mental note to take lunch here one day as the menu looked extremely wholesome and tasty."
"We stopped in for a bite of lunch on the way to oxford street for some shopping. We Arrived a few minutes before opening. They seated everyone waiting in a very timely manner. We ordered a roast chicken ceasar salad, garlic mushrooms and fish fingers with chips. I was pleasantly surprised that the salad came with nearly half a chicken. The garlic mushrooms were delightful and my partner said the rest of her meal was very tasty. I thought it seemed overstuffed but it just created a busy atmosphere with quick service. Considering we were in the centre of Covent garden, it was good value, good service and good quality."
Fantastic afternoon tea for my birthday. Very relaxed and quite informal. Great service and value for money. Also recommend combining this with some shopping along Marylebone High Street.
"Nipped in here for a bite to eat during the day. The pub is a beautiful space with a nice calm atmosphere. The burger I ordered was amazing. Very well cooked, not dry in the slightest. The staff were very courteous and very attentive. Would deff come back if in the area."
"I came here for Christmas lunchStarter was chicken parfait served with toasted brioche. The brioche was okay, but veering towards being just soggy toast. The chicken parfait itself was probably the worst starter ive ever had! It was served in a wine glass, which gives you some kind of idea of the consistency; it was almost runny underneath the harder skin of fat. The taste was awful and to top it off there was a scum around the side of the glass where they had presumably poured in the parfait and it had then settled leaving a mingy looking residue! I couldn't eat it and it's not often I won't eat what's put in front of me.For main it was roast turkey with 'all' the trimmings'. Though this was better then the starter by actually being edible, it too was really very poor. The Turkey itself was plentiful, but terribly dry; the meagre dash of gravy it was served with was soon soaked up. I would suggest a more generous helping of gravy in the first place or a gravy jug on the table. The roast potatoes were literally bite size, no exaggeration. And there were only two of them. These probably added up to half a normal sized roast potato altogether. And I can't even say the meal was served with sprouts, because I only had one sprout on my plate. One. Once again I would suggest that if decent portion sizes are not provided to start with, extra veg and potatoes are provided for the table to share. I will say the turkey was served on a bed of parsnip and carrot batons, which were more plentiful. Unfortunately though these were rock hard and were obviously completely undercooked.For pudding was Christmas pud. This was actually quite nice, being lovely and moist and piping hot throughout, if a bit small. Service was a bit slow, but the staff were very polite, friendly and helpful. In fact, if it weren't for the staff and the pudding, this would be a one star review."
"This is fine dining at it's very best. I had ham hock terrine followed by sea bream, both absolutely delicious. We didn't have a pudding as I had been given a birthday cake which was also delicious."
The Bunch of Grapes is on the Brompton Road near Harrods. We are staying in the area so we thought we would try it for a drink and s bite to eat. The atmosphere was good as was the service. We enjoyed our meals also. I would rate it 3.5 if I could as I felt it was above average.
i am very satisfy for excellence services. my tour is the best in this Restaurant. its fantastic restaurant
"I went here with two friends on Friday. The service was very friendly, nice cosy atmosphere on a soggy night in London. The price for food and half a bottle of wine was fab. I enjoyed my lobster burger (although it wasn't anything special), although my friends didn't finish their steaks. Again, they thought they were okay but wouldn't choose the steak there again. I'd definitely give the place another go."
"I was standing outside wasabi sushi & bento on Tottenham Court Road and hundreds of pounds worth of food was being thrown away. Took a picture, posted it on Facebook but obviously it didn't make it on their timeline. A guy asked if he could have some of the food being thrown and he was turned away.There is something seriously wrong with this world and this company who cannot have a decent and socially responsible way of dealing with leftovers. This was one shop out of many. It is painful to think this is what happens in all their restaurants around the country. I will never buy anything from them...."
Went back this year for Christmas day lunch and we enjoyed it so much. Of course we ended up in excess of 100 pounds per head but again the experience was fantastic.
Amazing pizza. Friendly service although it isn't table service so don't go expecting it. Great place with a lovely atmosphere.Definitely some of the best pizza ive ever had. Highly recommended.
"We came across San Lorenzo Fuoriporta few months ago and now that we live here we consider this restaurant our treat. The food is very good, well presented and fresh. The ambience is cosy and the service we received has been consistently good, especially from the really nice Italian guy, I don't remember his name -sorry-, who is always so smiling, welcoming and helpful. The price is fair, if I want to have a cheaper Italian dinner I can cook it at home, being Italian myself. Overall this restaurant is a great find."
"First of all, Pret a Manger is found all over London but this is the more known place for tourists.Pret a Manger offers fresh made sandwiches packed in the known triangle packets and some other light food but also warm drinks or soups. At Pret you won't find any expiry dates on the sandwiches for the simple reason that they are made fresh and the following day they won't sell them anymore (that's what the packets say) and give the leftovers to the homeless. Anyway, the sandwiches themselves are taste and fresh, many options and with a drink and a sack of crisps you have a very nice alternative for the traditional fast food chains and healthier as well!"
"ive been here before and liked it, so I know they can do better.We sat outside under the heaters and it was very warm, which made it all the stranger that our starters were cold. They were nice, but had obviously been sitting out.Our mains were on the cool side as well and we should have sent them back, but hey ho.The food was nice, though I'm not sure it worked out as good value.Service was good and a service charge of 10% is added to the bill, plus the waiter never brought our change back, so he got a few more quid on top."
"Just off a dusty and grey High Street tucked into a small side street is this rather trendy place that has an equally trendy young bunch of after work revellers. This would have been more in sync with Ladbroke Grove or Portobello Road, but maybe the owners can see what's coming for Kensal Rise and are ahead of the game. It has a nice ambience (perhaps a little kitsch in places) but the overall feel is interesting and inviting. There is an outdoor area which would be very nice on a good summer evening. Try the boiled pheasants eggs."
"We were going to the Playhouse Theatre and wanted to eat nearby as it was cold so we had pre-theatre dinner on a Saturday night. We hadn't booked but managed a window table - spectacular view, great service and lovely cocktails. The food was fine, not spectacular but tasty and well cooked - mid-price range for this area. We were a little surprised to find a couple of very rowdy groups, so it was by no means a quiet dinner and one couple actually asked to be moved away from one of the noisy contingents. The staff could see that other diners were unhappy with the noise (and some very loud swearing) but didn't do anything to control it - a shame, as it did spoil it a little. Nevertheless we would return and hope that we were just unlucky with our timing."
We came into Kennedy's before going out and we tried the classic fish and chips.Portions are really good and even if they are a bit oily the taste is good!Staff very nice!Por
"This is the first opened Hard Rock Cafe in the world! It was opened more than 40 years ago. Food and drinks are standard, but it is worth visiting!"
Perfect for take away!Sizes are huge and the fish is very excellent.strongly recommended
In the heart of Covent Garden you find a nice restaurant with good service and good food. It's special to eat here and you have a good choice of food and drinks.
"Stopped here because of high reviews. It was not a direct Tube route for us, so we were disappointed the first night when we were turned away because the entire restaurant was booked for a priveate party. Since we really wanted to try the sausage and pie with mash, we came back the next day, but they were out of the traditional mince meat pie... another disappointment. I had the cheesy mustard mash, chicken pie, and farmers gravy while Hubby had the cheesy mash, London smokey sausage, and farmers gravy. Both were good. On top of the previous disappointments, they did not take American Express. I would not rate the food as THAT good to overcome being turned away the first night, out of mince meat pie, and no acceptance of AmEx. Mother Mash would have earn an extra star if we just ran into it rather than trying to live up to the hype."
We had our work Christmas party here on 9.12.14. We all had an excellent time and found the staff to be really helpful and the top deck of venue to be the perfect size for our group (approx. 50-60 people). The duty manager was very helpful indeed. We would definitely return.
"A party of seven on a Friday evening in this friendly neighbourhood tapas bar in Pimlico.A warm welcome, good food and service, and very drinkable house wines made for a memorable evening.The tapas portions are good sized. We particularly enjoyed the meatballs, chorizo and calamares."
"Stopped for dinner on our way to the theatre and while initially impressed the kids menu is very limited with 4-5 dishes . The main menu fared better and the pizza I ordered was delicious. The main thing that let this place down was the staff and toilets. The staff looked harrassed and even when I explained I was taking my kids to the toilet they had cleared our unfinished plates. The toilets are across from the restaurant in a basement and you could have been forgiven for thinking you were in the saraha - they were unbearably hot, stuffy and very uncomfortable - not nice. Restaurant is in a great location but I would not rush back."
"The research behind each cocktail is attentive and looked-after: the selection and mix of the ingredients make them almost unique.The bar scene akin to the speakeasy ones is really enjoyable.Presentation of the cocktails is quite basic - but helps having a good trade-off between quality and price.I don't know what to say about the service: they had a quite straightforward approach, yet not rude, and tried to be helpful proposing valid alternatives in case one were not happy with one of the choices in the menu, but sometimes I had the impression they were a bit pressing.All in all, it is a place where I will gladly drink again more than once."
"A lovely day in London. Enjoying the weather and St Katherine's Dock. To top it all was a gorgeous 2course meal. Try the steak, it melts in your mouth and the it's flavoursome. Absolutely delicious. The staff are really nice too . Perfect place to eat"
"Not a lot of choice on the menu, food is disgusting and staff walking around with a face like thunder and rude service, would definitely not recommend this restaurant!!"
"I once left Elliot's after I had sat down for lunch because I didn't fancy a single thing on their menu. However, I decided to try their dinner menu last Friday, 8th Nov, and I am glad I did.The pigs cheeks were amazing, the hare and sage a delight! It was so worth going back, but I do think they are on the 'pricey' side for what you get. Four small plates, two cheese plates, bottle of wine, 2 cocktails came to £98 (inc 12% service charge) for the two of us, which is a bit 'ouch'! However, I have to admit the food was very flavorsome, I think they should consider getting some wines in for under £20. The staff need to be a touch more aware of their customers though - it was difficult to get their attention sometimes, but they are v friendly. Do I think it's value for money?...debatable."
"The flavours of Dishoom are well worth the wait for dinner. For us it was about an hour, but the staff were friendly and served us hot tea. Once inside, our waiter was very helpful and suggested combinations for us to share. We had the Ruby Chicken, the Prawn Moilee and the Chicken Berry Britannia - all were delicious and not too spicy, so suited all of our party. Will definitely be back!"
"We did not see the park or view (praised by others) as it was on a winter night but we thoroughly enjoyed the fare served in this beautiful hotel restaurant as well as the kind service.The food was really delicious, the starters (crab lasagne and pigeon salad), whose portions were exactly what they should be, were worth the best restaurants in town. It continued with the tuna cooked to perfection as we had asked for (two different cookings for 2 different people). Finally our lovely Italian-born waitress, Sonia, who had been waiting on us gently and smilingly advised a limoncello soufflet for dessert that was just fantastic. A perfect evening then with a special mention to Sonia who advised us throughout the meal ! We will come back!"
"A brilliant meeting place for friends and a great conversation piece. ive never seen a Damien Hurst and it was pretty incredible, if a little weird to have a life size cow ""mooing"" down at you whilst you ate! There were 5 of us, we were recommended sharing starters which was a great idea and having a whole roast chicken and an enormous slab of steak with skinny chips and steak and a couple of plates of veg. And then the puddings... Chocolate mousse from heaven, rhubarb and apple pie and salted caramel fondue with homemade marshmallows and doughnuts. With cocktails and wine it cost £200. Go there, it's different and fun!"
"Hello Judy Here again, we went to Hampstead Heath with our son Stephen and his wife Lisa to look at some Antique shops which our son had seen on telly? we had a walk around the village area and found this little gem in Perrins Court outside a beautiful cottage dripping in flowers, well what a find it was so nice we decided to have lunch there, we had a luvely welcoming we sat at the round table by the front door which was very nice and comfortable, we ordered a bottle of wine to go with the meal, and Stephen had a beer to start and I had a glass of champagne, for our starters Steve had Mussels provencale 1/2 portion, Stephen had a 1/2 lobster thermidor, and Lisa had Baked Aubergine I did not have a starter, for our mains I had the Grilled Dover Sole off the bone with Saute potatoes, Steve & Lisa had 'Large prawns in Thermidor sauce and Stephen had the Veal Chop in Rosemary Sauce, every part of the meal was fabulous could not fault any of it, the manager came over and we had a nice chat with him, the staff were fabulous could not do enough for us, we had another bottle of wine and another bottle of champagne and a very pleasant afternoon, will be returning I'm sure in the summer.JudyPS this is one of the few restaurants that has normal portions or 1/2 portions on the menu if you are like me and do not like a large meal then this is fantastic."
All the sushi is ready made but tastes fresh and yummy unlike the ones you get from a supermarket. Also quite affordable.
"I had heard a lot about this place and the food, but I could not quite picture a hotdog and champagne combination.I had to go myself and see and I can safely say the palce did not disapoint. With a wide range of over 20 different types of hot dogs with differnt types of topping and dozens of different champagne choices this place is one of the most unique and fun places I have come to eat in London (and thats saying something)The service was great and attentive with the waiter giveing us recommendations and being very knowlegable about the champagne and drinks on offer.The decor is quirky and fun, the atmosphere great and the food even better.The one down side I could put to the is that if your going for a meal to fill you up, then this place may disapoint as the hotdogs are small.With that said they make a great hotdog and fantastic side orders, the champagne always helps as well.Highly recommended and will be visiting again in the near future."
"Delicious food - Aubergine bake, Brava potatoes served dry with delicious dip, Pimientos Padron and white anchovies were all good.Calamari was a bit ordinary. Courgette fritada more like a ratatouille with potatoes - ie wetter than fritada implies.Nice Rose wine. Free bread and amazing AÌøoli for those ordering 6 tapas. I suggest requesting the bread is warmed in the oven as it was served cold.Seats a little uncomfortable (cushions provided but still not quite enough) and basic decor but food tasty. I would go again ."
"Stopped on the way back from Borough Market, where you have to queue for ages for a coffee. This place had good service and excellent coffee."
"I have eaten at Good Earth in both Knightsbridge and here in Wandsworth a number of times. Almost without exception the food has always been consistently good, the service reliable and the surroundings very pleasant. I have no hesitation in recommending Good Earth for an excellent Chinese meal.Following an unfortunate incident at the Knightsbridge restaurant (which I won't go into as it is irrelevant for this), I took the unusual step of bothering to write to the owner of Good Earth about my experience. The way in which my ÷complaint' was dealt with speaks volumes about this business and the way it is run. There was a genuine desire to understand what had happened and how. No standard letters, no fobbing off, but a real interest in putting things right. As a result they haven't lost customer but gained an advocate instead.I should make it clear that I was entertained at the Wandsworth restaurant by the owner. He even made the effort to come to the restaurant to meet us and had personally chosen our food for the night. This included delicious things that I have never ordered before. We had a great evening and have returned several times since. Well done Good Earth, many service businesses could learn from your example. Thank you."
"Lunchtime - quite a few customers in, but no trouble finding a table as it's a very big place. We had the fish finger sandwich from the light bites list (strips of real fish in a light batter, served in a soft bun with chips on the side) and it was very good. Choice of real ales and a decent cider for my wife made this a good place for lunch. If you want to eat outside there is a courtyard (too hot for us on the day we visited) and several tables out at the side of the pub."
The staff are always helpful and the food is excellent.
"8 of us from work went here for lunch today.We all ate from their £8.95 lunch menu (starter+main).Meantime beer in cans, pils-y beer on draft.Everyone thought the food was excellent. Service friendly. Ambience nice (if you like some strange music).It was my first visit, but I actually live just across the road. It won't be my last."
"My wife & I had a really nice evening last night at the Park Terrace, helped by a travelzoo voucher which made the meal such fantastic value. We like other reviewers would only be happy to pay the going rate.Our cocktails where heaven in a glass and once we tasted them we guessed that what follows would be of a high standard and we were not disappointed. I can highly recommend the quality of the food and the presentation, some of the plates looked to good to eat. The Service was polite, professional and not to intrusive just how I like it. The restaurant will close in January for refurbishment until March so I suggest go soon before you miss out!"
"Flowers ,Flowers everywhere!!!!One of the most beautiful and atmospheric small restaurants we have been too.A real Gem! Food top quality and presented with taste and style .You are made to feel very special . Romantic it is . Outside seating , either on the small balcony or at the front on the ground floor, surrounded by flowers ,,, so lovely . They have A resident pianist too that quietly creates a truly romantic feel .. Wonderful !!!!!!"
"This used to be the best fish & chip shop in London , if not the UK, and was always a stop-off point before getting a train from Marylebone. Since it re-opened after the fire the quality has gone down, the prices (which were never cheap but not too bad) have shot up - £10 for takeaway cod and chips is ridiculous - and if they ever run out of something it's always the cheaper items such as their fish cakes or cod roe. Coincidence And it's very annoying that you can't buy bottles or cans and have to make do with dispensed soft drinks, which of course have a much higher profit margin. Don't get me wrong, the food is still much better than average, but their prices and bad customer service - waiting times are now beyond a joke - mean alternative arrangements are now being made."
Here i found a dark beer that in my oppinion beats the Guinness. A very nice place with very good food also.
"I was really looking forward to this restaurant but sadly it's just a tourist trap relying on its history. Average good, very poor service."
"Stopped in here after work on a Friday evening with my boyfriend and his colleague. The bar itself was absolutely gorgeous with the ornate oak carving and panels on the walls. Excellent mood lighting with posh, comfy seating. But as cocktails were about £16 each (not a joke) and there was no cider to be found, I only stayed for one."
"I love TGI Friday's- especially since my parents are American it's a great taste of American dining. Came to the London restaurant with my fiance and left extremely disappointed. Bad seating arrangements- we was told that they were probably sending loads of staff home so we couldn't sit in certain places. Understandable, but not really positive to tell your customers that you're going to be sending all your staff home before 6pm? We ended up at the bar area which was more comfortable, but had terrible bar staff. They were so rude and slow! My fiance waited while they acknowledged him, but stood and chatted with each other instead of serving. Poor attitudes as well, made us very uncomfortable to be near the bar area in the end. Won't be going back to this one again!"
Hadn't been here before but found it on Yelp during our London vacation. Little bit of a wait but made worthwhile with a nice blood orange old fashioned. Bartender chips a block of ice for a nice touch on the cocktails. Not much choice on the menu (steak or steak) but they make the concept work. We had the signature flat iron and short rib tips. Both excellent. Well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Great side dishes too. We had the cabbage and fries. Service at the bar and tables was friendly and attentive. Meal is topped off with complimentary salted caramel ice cream cone rolled in dark chocolate shavings. Tasty! Wonderful evening in a fun and energetic venue.
"this is the 2nd night we have been here this week, the stuffed mushrooms are to die for and so are the tacos, wait... and so are the steaks, lamb chops fajitas and ribs lol will deffo be back apart from the very reasonable priced food, the friendly service we received from kamal and all of his staff will keep us coming back. we felt comfortable and relaxed they even replaced my girlfriends drink on the house when they saw she didn't really like it.... to many brilliant staff to name indiveidually but all do an amazing job. we will be back as soon as we can xxxx"
"Very good selection of food so I don't think you can go far wrong but compared to some other places, very over priced for the same quality and quantity. A nice atmosphere though and efficient staff!"
"We meandered the streets near our hotel in search of a good restaurant. We eventually ended up in the Reform Social and Grill. My friend & I both ordered the Cottage Pie which was really yummy. It was their version which consisted of taking a large baked potato, and scooping out the contents and filling it with beef & gravy and then have little whipped potato balls on top. It came with a side of Ale Gravy and I paired it with a side of green beans. It was truly comfort food and very yummy."
I always visit here every two or three months.It's great for decent portions of burgers and fries. Page rock n roll memorabilia on the walls are amazing.A fully stocked bar here as well.Only downside is it can get too busy with queues outside.
"There are dozens of these around London and they are definitely worth a try. The variety is endless, the food is fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. The service is quick"
Went in here on a Thursday evening in a half full restaurant. Taken to table by young woman who was disinterested. She seated us at what was possibly the worste table in the room in the middle of the room along a corridor through the restaurant. She did say anything to us just plopped the menus on the table. We were out for a special occasion and just looked at each other and left. Going out is not just about the food but also the service. If a restaurant does not care about giveing us the best table it can it won't care about the food. We left without any of the 4 or 5 staff near the front door even trying to find out what was wrong....if I owned this business I would want to know.
"Fabulous experience at this restaurant, after my sons graduation, we Arrived tired and a little early but we were seated quickly and they couldnt do enough for my mother who has recently had surgery and can only eat puree'd food. The food for the rest of our party was outstanding, the sesame seared tuna perfect and the deserts appropriately decadant!! we had a travelzoo deal which made it even better - the cocktails were delicious especially the green woodpecker!The staff have been trained to a very high standard and this shows in the naturally discrete but friendly approach they have to diners, we would definitely recommend this restaurant and will go there again"
happened upon this great burger joint with friends after work. staff lovely. very reasonably priced food and was super tasty. definitely going back. recommend the milkshakes in particular
Even thought rated average I would probably return. Fish and chips hot but just had to wait a bit for it to come. That's would be ok but nobody was keeping me informed on progress. Been a while since I had Huss so a bit of a shock it is now more exposure than cod. When did that happen. Too many people rate things on TA as VG or E and I can only think people's benchmarks are a bit off. I used the takeaway so cannot comment on the restaurant.
"We have been to Rules on a number of visits to London, one of our favourite restaurants.The food is always top notch and the staff could not be more helpful polite and welcoming.Well worth the little extra cost if you want a nice meal. This is the oldest restaurant in London many many famous people have eaten there, it has a lot of history, check it out on google!!"
"I had the paper prawns, then green curry. ive never had better. Go there. Small, cozy, nice and welcoming."
"Very enjoyable meal with great food and great wine. Staff was absolutely great with suggestions from the menu for our meal and wine selections to compliment our meal. Deserts were also wonderful. We enjoyed a very relaxing, enjoyable evening visiting with old friends. The wine selections are fabulous. Highly recommended."
Loved it! Simple but very tasty authentic Thai food and very friendly and efficient service. Having been to Thailand a few times I can recommend Rosa's as a true taste of Thailand.
"My girlfriend and I ended up here whilst we waited for our table in Gauchos Steak Restaurant next door.The cocktails were very nice and relatively cheap compared to other Chelsea cocktail bars. Between £10-£15 each.The bar had a great atmosphere, everything we wanted from a Chelsea night out. Good music, attentive bar staff and comfortable surroundings.I will definitely return!"
"if you want to visit coven garden, the restaurant is in the main hall in front of apple market. The menu is correct, with burgers, Fish and chips, pizza for children. Very pleasant to have a lunch to feel the covent garden atmosphere."
"I love Japanese food and this is a great find. Superb ramen. The soup base is tasty (I don't usually drink all the soup in a ramen bowl but I did this time), ramen has the right texture and the pork is nice too. I also had the karaage - marinated fried chicken, which is one of the best I have tried. Service was fine, as I was expecting fast food type of service but it was better than that. It is true that they bring the bill to you in the middle of your meal, but I don't think they meant to imply you have to finish your meal quick, as I didn't anyway. I just ate at leisurely speed and presented the bill to the till at the end. Tip: Instead of ordering a large version of the ramen, order a regular size and try a side dish such as karaage, then you have two dishes in one meal."
"Good atmosphere, staff attentive and fun, but not sure how well they took the feedback we tried to give. Live music was excellent, just the right volume ( often hard to do) , but let down by the worse than average food. The tartiflette was a watery potato stew rather than the cheesey artery-clogging indulgence we were expecting, the waitress told us it was because it was hard to get the right potatoes, We suggested it was a lack of the correct cheese but were then assured it was made properly with gruyere! By then didn't have the will to point out it should be made with reblouchon. Dont think we go back, not for food anyway."
My family often go but I had avoided it. Judging by the reviews I am not the only one to think this is awful. I wanted meat and got rubbish. A few almost inedible pieces of cheapish uncooked meat One of the six small pieces made me so sick I had to extract it from my mouth in a napkin. I could not chew or swallow it.. The plate far too expensive for what it was. at least the bottle of beer although expensive was large. Even the small prawns and squid were not good although unusual. Service makes it even more of a rip off because service is so friendly and food so bad. I am not the only one to think that. Place full of young girls chatting which is just about what it is good for. Not been to other Wagamamas but again like Carluccios and many many others just shows how a chef even Ramsey can give a place a name to draw people in and then watch it go to ruin..A lot of water again with few bits floating in it.
"We visited here to kill an hour before we had dinner booked elsewhere, happy hour cocktail menu is really good with lots of choice, great interior design but was lacking atmosphere, I assume it would be a lot better on a Friday/ Saturday evening but all in all not bad"
"First visit to this restaurant with 3 adults and one child. Great atmosphere, staff friendly and welcoming, gave great recommendations and just couldn't be more attentive. Food was beautiful, in particular the okra fries and the chocolate cake with chai custard was the perfect end to the meal, real thought has gone into this menu with a good variety of dishes. A great range of drinks, especially the non alcoholic cocktails. Price reflects the quality of food and the effort that goes into each dish. Will definitely be visiting again soon, worth the hour and a half journey for us!"
Stayed 2 nights at The mitre as we were going to an O2 concert and day out in London. Staff were very welcoming and hotel room very spacious and clean will definitely come back.
"Been there with my friends , we shared a pizza a Birna , limoncello coffe e cake Best value ever Recommended to all"
Now this is my favorite sushi in London! There are many different sushi sets so you can choose whatever you want and add some more food to your personal set. Especially I enjoyed the coffee bubble tea which has its own interesting taste. The food is always fresh and the staff is friendly .
Decor good and warm atmosphere - food great and good value - friendly staff- very efficient and happy to help
We stopped to refresh our palates in this busy outlet and were very pleased with the quality and prices of our drinks.
"Menu is large and seems unchanged for thirty years. Downstairs is so noisy, with flat-surface acoustics, so you can hear the conversation from three tables away, rather from your fellow tabled guests. Upstairs is quieter, despite the pianist playing Volare, etc. The food was disappointing. My liver was stringy and although ordered as ""pink"" was overlooked. My wife's sea bass was hard and flavourless. My starter of carpaccio of beef, had come straight out of the fridge. The plate was so cold it could barely be touched and the meet was dry and curling up at the edge. At £70 per head, with wine, it was poor value. I will not return"
"My friend booked dinner there,we had a great deal - and we both were really satisfied with the service, food and drinks. Nice and cozy place."
"We stumbled on this pub as we were waiting for a show.Old fashioned, traditional pub which felt very friendly. We had a bottle of wine and nibbles - all very nice and very reasonable.Not a bad place to be."
"Big bar, all stripped wood and old tables and chairs. Good range of beers and spirits with quick service at the bar. Saw people devouring good looking pizzas so will try that next time. Good, friendly mix of drinkers. Beside us we had a few locals hammering back beers and later a bunch of Thai guys on prosecco. Enjoyed it and look forward to sinking a few in The Three Johns again soon."
The freshest meals prepared in Stratford. Great service and all the meals are delicious. Be prepared to queue as the word on the quality has got out!!
"We have ordered pizza from here several times and the quality of the food is outstanding. We have family in Spain and the quality of the food you get in the Mediterranean for a reasonable price is outstanding. Well Ibleo offers the same quality food at a great price in the UK.Delicious food, highly recommended."
The burgers here were good and exceeded our expectations. The service was excellent by our waitress Monica who was friendly and with a sense of humor.
"So I casually went to lunch with a friend, we stumbled upon TGIs wondering to ourselves why we hadn't been in before. I ordered a BLT Chicken Sandwich which came with Fries.Well, these fries... These fries were, amazing, I have never eaten anything so beautiful in my life, they were the perfect temperature, they had a dream like crunch and tasted like little sticks of heaven. I don't normally eat all my fries at lunch time - potato makes me sleepy at my desk if I have too much at lunch - but I couldn't stop, these fries kept enticing me in until there was none left. I will definitely be revisiting this TGI Fridays soon for some more heavenly strips of potatoes. I strong suggest you do too."
We had never been to one of these restaurants before not known in the area we live but we discovered them on a recent trip to London and we were very impressed.The choice and quality was excellent and very reasonably priced for London we used several different ones in the city and all gave excellent friendly servive.
"Reasonable choice in what is the basement of the mandarin orientalReasonable food , sensibly priced but the whole experience was let down somewhat by the throughly disinterested staffBeen back for a drink and ""snack"" at the bar which was a much better experienceBurger - recommendedAll in all great for a quick bite after an afternoon shopping but certainly not a destination restaurant"
"A friend and I went for dinner at Brasserie Blanc on a Tuesday night. I chose the restaurant mainly due to its proximity to Waterloo as my friend now lives out of London and needed to catch a train home from the mainline station later that evening.I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants and wasn't expecting much from Brasserie Blanc Ò we just needed somewhere that was conveniently located, not too noisy and without too fast a turnover. Not that easy at 7pm on the South Bank, where theatre- and cinema-goers are out in full force. However, the restaurant exceeded my expectations - it was very pleasant and we will go back.Pros:Excellent service. I hadn't seen my friend for a long while and we had a lot of catching up to do. Our waiter was very attentive but not intrusive and was happy to give us all the time we needed. We didn't feel rushed once and we were in there for 2.5 hours.The restaurant is well designed - tables not too close together, not too noisy, looks reasonably nice and stylish in an unexciting sort of way.Good choice of wine by the glass - they were out of Viognier but the chardonnay was surprisingly good.Cons:Food was nothing special. Our main courses Arrived literally minutes after ordering - we both exclaimed in surprise at seeing them so swiftly. The plates were very hot, which always makes me think they've been left under the hot lights for a while, and the cauliflower was too al dente and needed somethingto jazz it up a little. Fish was on the dry side and skin very crispy. Portions not huge. Apple tart for pudding was bland and the pastry stodgy - I left the base of mine.It was expensive. For 2 main courses, 2 puddings, 2 small glasses wine and 2 x mint tea we paid £85 (including service). I wouldn't have minded this if the food had been better but it seemed like a lot for a pretty average meal. As I said, I will go back as Brasserie Blanc was very pleasant and very convenient but I'll probably choose the cheapest main on the menu next time and won't order pudding."
"Oh Tom yet again you have produced a wonderful lunch for my wife, her mum and myself at such short notice again!First let me thank Tom for squeezing us in at such very short notice. Again! He even remembered me from my first visit and my review on TA.We all had the roast dinner, 1 lamb, 1 beef and I had half a chicken. Yes half a chicken!As others have stated Tom describes each meal to perfection, and each meal delivers on quality and taste!The lamb and beef was very well cooked, moist and succulent!My chicken was cooked in garlic, lemon and thyme, slowly cooked, the meat fell off the bone.Very moist with crispy skin.Vegetables cooked just right, with a firm crunch and the roast potatoes are as good as it gets!The gravy also fresh and very tasty and just thick enough. The walkway between the restaurant and bar gives you an insight to the kitchen, don't be fooled by the size, Tom and his team produce one the finest meals in Greenwich. Dessert was 1 chocolate fudge cake and 2 bakewell tarts each with a dollop of ice cream and a jug of fresh cream.All diveine and tasty and well welcomed, the icing on the cake! No pot of tea this time just a great cup of coffee with warm milk.Next time I promise to pre-book Tom, and i shall have the lamb shank or the gammon or maybe both! Maybe have a midweek breakfast!You feel that your one of the family, and Tom always ensures a great meal.At £42 for three meals desserts and a coffee not only cheap but it's honest family food!It's well worth the visit, but book before hand, seems only I'm allowed to get away with a late sameday booking!And the mother in law loved the fuss he made of her! She even walked out with a box of chocolates.Tom appreciates the feedback, if you visit please add a review on TA .Be back very soon"
"I love this place, great owner/staff and great food. Im vegan so I have only tried those options and from what I have tried I am not disappointed, although my fiancee didnt like the moussaka one time. The Falafels are amazing, and the Hummus Beiruty is perfect!!The ONLY reason this place isn't five stars is because they shut when they want to. They state that they are open until 11pm most nights, but when I go to order they can be closed, and this has happened numerous times. I even rang up once and specifically asked when they would shut that day, they said 10pm... I turned up at 9.15pm after leaving an event early just to order from here and guess what, they were shut again. Apart from that I recommend this place."
"Highly recommended. Every dish is good to amazing. Their specials of the day is definitely worth trying, especially their fish."
"I have been eating here for a number of years and have never been disappointed with the greeting of the staff, service and quality of the food served."
Went here as a Friday night treat with hubby. Had scallops (£10) followed by 1/2 lobster (18) Tiny portion of lobster more like a big prawn. Nice but very expensive 120 for 2 of us.
"We ate here after a particularly long evening in a bar. The noodles were excellent, and huge. They have a £3.99 starter which Mrs M could have easily been happy with. Basically everything is yummy. And don't forget to try the plum wine - wow!"
"I ordered hamburger, milkshake and nachos. Superb quality! It tastes so good! The hamburger was perfect medium fried, and the milkshake were the best I ever had. The staff was very friendly, helpful and happy. Great place! I recommend."
"It's not in the center or very close to most tourist attractions, but in an area that you would like to see if you came to see the real London as well. The food is good, and so are the prices and the service. Only drawback that it's a small place, and it doesn't serve beer, though they don't have a problem if you bring it yourself from the nearby store (they offered)."
"This is the second time ive dined here and the staff, food and service were exceptional as always. Great tasting food and the staff are happy to recommend items for you as the menu offers exciting new dishes. £70 for starters, mains, sides, coffee and wine is excellent value for money. Will definitely be back for a 3rd visit."
A marvellous place within tripping distance of the British Museum but a million miles away from and apart from the tourist traps nearby. Discreetly tucked away in the basement of a bookshop this is a fine place for an afternoon tea in central London.
"This is the best place ive ever been for eating italian food in London!They have a fair price, an amazing staff, a great ambient and delicious meals. It's located in Fulham Road, a little bit far from London downtown, and this lets they have a good price for the meals. ive loved having lunch or dinner there.You can order for a lasagna or a pasta and pay half you would pay in Oxford Street or any famous place in London."
"I really should have reviewed The Mitre before now, as I visit fairly regularly-just meeting for drinks, or participating in the Sunday night quiz.Yesterday was the first time I tried the menu, and was not disappointed. A roast isn't always an option for a vegetarian, but they do a delicious nut roast-with all the usual trimmings. Although nut roasts can often be a bit dry, this one was well cooked and tasty.The accompanying vegetables were 'al dente'-perfect.I'll definitely eat here again. The pub has its own distinctive decor and character-quite in keeping with its Greenwich location. There is plenty of room, including a pleasant outdoor terrace. Staff are efficient and helpful, and the drinks menu has lots of choice. I would recommend The Mitre to any visitors to Greenwich, as well as those who work/live locally."
went in here for couple of drinks in Greenwich staff were friendly and welcoming.very busy pub but would definitely recommend
I have short visit to London and craving for Malaysian food and my aunty bring me to this restaurant. This restaurant offer you delicious food. Very comfortable place with calm environment. I will definitely go again in my next visit to London.
Lovely sushi and lots of it. But please could you put some alternatives to salmon I the lunch boxes? Bit of tuna would be nice.
"Came here for a snack while wandering around Soho - incredible value at £5 for a really hearty toastie. The BBQ Chicken with coleslaw and cheddar on sourdough was amazing, and the service was fast and very friendly. Overall I couldn't fault it and will definitely be returning!"
"I had an urge to have a Calzone. The waitress (possibly owner) said they do not do them but if I ring ahead they will try and prepare one. It didn't matter my pizza was smashing as was my Wife's Carbonnara. The lady playing the piano topped it all off, and it was good VFM for Central London."
We were not expecting much at 10:30 on a Tuesday night after seeing the Phantom of the Opera across the street. The restaurant was moderately busy and the food was very good. Service was great.
"Waitress was lovely. 'Long'Gin cocktail for £8 tasted like squash and had big ice cubes. Nothing 'long' about it. Disappointing. The pizzas were handmade and the dough was fresh but mine had caught and had clearly burnt in places. The greens had been put over in order to cover it up but it shouldn't have been served to me. The waitress gave us a £8 drink, rum, on the house which was a bit better. The kids had two lemonades which came to 7.20. What a joke. I guess you are paying for the location but the pricing was dishonest I thought. WON'T go again"
"We visited Itadaki Zen in September after searching the internets for somewhere new (and more importantly vegan) to eat in London. My girlfriend and I had mixed opinions at the end of our late night meal. I'm not a massive fan of Japanese food normally, but I actually really enjoyed the dishes - I had a variety of starters and tried the Amafuta Don Set for my main; a rice based vegetable dish with miso soup and marinated peanuts which was very nice and filling. My other half felt the food was slightly overpriced, and commented on the small portions. We both thought the service was very good and the staff were very friendly and welcoming - especially as we were the last to leave! Worth a visit for something different in the center of London."
"Tried after the the reviews on tripadvisor. I know people can be pedantic, and maybe slightly nit picky. However the previous reviews were spot on. Excellent all round. ""Superb"". No issues or faults, the chef loves cooking and it shows. Happy to see a man proud of his work. Service attentive, not pretentious or over bearing, just friendly and efficient. Putting this on my favourite list. Being a foodie and having spent good money on good meals at Michelin restaurants,, this is a gem."
"Went there on Saturday evening. Not too busy. They have the music so loud it is hard to talk. Not at all relaxing. Tables are very small. Not comfortable. Main problem is that each tapas style dish is very expensive and very small. We were so hungry when we left we went to the much more reliable Italian next door for some starters. Very little duck meat in the salad and the scallops were floating in tasteless dishwater. The waiters also have an annoying habit of taking away the menu, which acts as a place mat, every few minutes so its a problem ordering more. Much better options around. Avoid!"
"We were staying at an Airbnb in the area, and did not manage to get a reservation for dinner. We were delighted that they could accommodate us for breakfast at 10 o'clock on a Saturday morning with only a 15 minute wait. Without question, this was the best almond croissant ive ever had in my entire life. And how delightful to have interesting, unusual breakfast_ This is not the place to go if you just want basic eggs, bacon, and toast. But if you want something different and delicious, it's highly recommended! Everything we ate was absolutely outstanding. It's family-style at a long table so you are elbow to elbow with strangers which can be a little strange. Also, not great options for picky kids. We are going back tomorrow -- that's how good it is!"
"Travel in London can be a bit hard on the wallet and when you are walking about seeing the sites you get very hungry. Pret has a few locations and each one is consistently good and fresh. Everything is freshly made and the soups are fantastic. Ambiance is cafe style but you taste buds won't care. Eat at Pret, you won't regret it."
"I love home deliveries from Tootoomoo! The food always arrives still piping hot and crying out to be eaten! We oblige - with relish!! I'm only holding back the fifth star till they can refine the online ordering system. Choosing the dishes couldn't be easier but if you're a returning customer be sure to know your password! Being a simple soul I have one password with two minor tweaks! When neither works on repeated attempts I get irritated! Hungry and irritated!! Yes there's a guest sign-in but that only seems to work once! The thing is - the food is so good it needs to be easier to access and enjoy! Clearly a lot of love, knowledge and experience go into creating these dishes! The online delivery menu is easy to navigate - the hard bit is limiting how much is selected! I can't believe there are many lovers of fresh pan Asian food yet to discover TTM! But if you're one, go find! You won't regret it"
"We are long time clients of VB. But for our last visit there was confusion about our reservation time, the wine steward did not understand our request (he bought a bottle of Champers when we only wanted a glass and brought glasses of red wine when we wanted a full bottle.) And the entree was not the usual hot served meal and the sauce for the thermidor (which we love) was not up to usual standard. (It seems like it was standing for serving for a while.)"
I visited The Rising Sun with some friends for some well earned after work drinks! The place was busy but the staff were very quick in taking our drinks order. In particular a lovely Irish lady called Michelle made us feel very welcome and gave us useful advice on the wine. Will definitely visit again.
Lovely welcome from the owner.Really tasty beef pies.Bargain £2.50 corkage on byo wine.Will try and come back again.
great atmosphere in the restaurant. customer service was not robotic as I have experienced on many occasions at different restaurants. Dave who attended to us interacted with us frequently throughout our time there. Definitely recommend the entire experience to those who may be hungry and in the carnaby street area.
"We were going to the theatre nearby and decided to do a pre theatre at Rules for handiness, but we were held up in the taxi as the Christmas lights were being switched on and London was at a standstill. By the time we got there the place was full and buzzing but our waiter ascertained we were heading for the theatre at 7.30 so he pushed us through quickly. The quality of the food was exceptional and every dish was most enjoyable, we only managed 2 courses but there were 4 of us so we had a fair sampling of the menu. Our waiter was most helpful and had a sound knowledge of the dishes on offer, and although waiting on several tables he made time to chat to each of us as he took our order. An excellent venue for theatres nearby, good food and nicely served. The only problem is many folk know this and to get in there you need to book well in advance."
"Had an excellent meal, the staff are very friendly and helpful. Good menu choices and very good tasty food. Decor and atmosphere very relaxed and didn't feel at all rushed."
"We went with friends for a catch up chat and informal dinner. On a Tuesday night they have a great deal for 4 small glasses of wine for £10 - a king of light to try different wines from a region.There's a good selection of platters and bites - the cheese selection was unusual and excellent, and a generous veg platter.We did feel the service could have been a little more responsive, but they were busy, which I suppose is a good sign! Would still go there again."
"This is the second time we have eaten at TONKOTSU. We enjoyed the ramen the first time, we were looking forward to a return. But something has changed. The staff appeared to be indifferent and distant. The place looked dull and dreary. And the food...it was..just ok, nothing special. I didn't leave the place feeling like i wanted to return and didn't get the feeling that the staff cared whether i did or not. I thoroughly depressing experience. I hope the management take note and do something about it. As i said, we came back because the first experience was very good...i wonder what has changed?"
"Badly overpriced.. Ridiculous waiting time.. Not worth the money at all.. Got cod and chips tonight, they said 7-10 mins, waited 20 then all the chips were limp and brown.. For that price?! Got scampi last time I was in there, only tonight to see them put scampi in the fryer from a bag from the freezer so basically I could of bought scampi from tescos, deep fried it myself and saved myself £6.50!! Cheek!"
Just had Sunday lunch at The Durell arms and was quite impressed. Good atmosphere and nice friendly staff.I had the roast lamb and my partner had the beef short rib which were both very nice. I would recommend.
"Christmas eve lunch. The game bird dishes entice in a menu laden with classic British fare but it is the game and kidney pie that wins us. It proves a marvelous choice: tender meat in the richest gravy topped with a crisp crust. To follow, a so-so sticky toffee pudding offset by a superb apple crumble. Attentive staff and warm ambiance. Quite pricey but worth it."
"There is so much to choose from you can't fail to be happy, everything is fresh and quickly topped up, the staff are very hands on clearing away tables and plates, there is no rush to leave your table - we were a party of 18 and there from 1.30pm to 4pm - very reasonable prices too - only small thing - just the white chocolate fountain today so the milk chocolate one was definitely missed by our children."
Fantastic service with expert knowledge of teas to complement different courses. I had a lovely choc treat for my birthday . We had to take some back in a box ! Highly recommend
"Small but cosy tapas bar, nice atmosphere in a good location, the helpings are tiny, as expected and very reasonably priced. My cod tasted nice, but my friend found the octopus somewhat disappointing. I loved the glass of white wine, there was a nice drink selection on the menu. The Spanish waitress was very helpful indeed, service with a smile!"
"We have been going to Monsoon now for quite a few years and the level of service and the quality of food has never once altered.We love it so much that we still make the time to visit even though we have now moved out the area.We have eaten in a few Indian restaurants, but none of them compare, and the meal deal they have on sundays through to thursdays is also excellent value with a starter, main, rice and side all for £9.95Once you have tasted the food, you will definately return!!"
Isaac was our waiter and from the beginning he was really helpful with recommendations about pizzas and beers. We also had a great chat with him despite he was very busy all the time. Pizzas where great (gorgonzola and aubergine pizzas) and the dessert was simply brilliant (sweet pizza with original Nutella sauce inside).We want to repeat experience in this restaurant and in the same place in Carnaby St!
"Lunch before a trip across the road to see Spamalot. Lovely setting on the Thames. After a bit of a dodgy start- they couldn't do club sandwiches and then a burger was a step too far- the meal Haddock and chips was excellent. Real tartare sauce and fish that melted in the mouth. Service was excellent, they evn gave us a bottle of wine because of the problems at the beginning. Their house Pinot Grigio is one of the nicest I have ever tasted. Will definitely go again when in London"
Having had a bad experience in this joint in the past I thought I'd give it another chance as it had a new ramen menu.The ittenbari ramen we ordered was seeped in a tasty clear broth that was not too salty. The noodles were not too soft but the egg was a bit bland. The green tea came in a generous sized teapot and rounded off a quick meal.This ramen place is reasonably priced compared to some of the swankier new openings in London.The decor needs a little updating but otherwise a nice joint.
"We had a fantastic time at the white hart yesterday. Gia and crew were so friendly and welcoming and let us use some space to have our vintage hair & makeup party. They were fab and made us feel so welcome. Thank you guys! You helped make our day a special one. Food, atmosphere & staff are great. Highly recommend."
"The Wagamama concept has been driven down by the fact that there is now one on almost every street corner. It's still popular though and the Putney branch can get really busy some lunch times. When it's busy, I'd avoid this one because you can't hear a word of what people of saying due to the background noise (it's like school dinners!) and the waiting staff are liable to make mistakes (it's happened at least once on each of the last 3 visits). Good if you're in a hurry though, service is speedy."
"I only found this place on Trip Advisor after staying in the premier. It is located down a small street, don't let appearances be deceiveing. The food is amazing, I had ribs and pulled pork, it cost around £15, the ribs were huge and so nice. I would highly recommend. Great value for money too."
"I can't believe it took me this long to find Elliots. ive eaten at most of its Stoney Street neighbours, picked up coffee from Monmouth almost next door, and shopped at Brindisa opposite. I met a friend here for a pre-theatre supper and would definitely come back. We each had a couple of tapas including a great souffle and wonderful salad with truffle dressing. Not cheap, but good - and in my book that rates as worth it."
"Tried this restaurant for the first time yesterday. I had chicken yellow curry, and shared a portion of vegetables with my friend. I thought the food was very tasty and would eat here again. Only small negative comment is the green tea - would have been nice to have tea leaves rather than tea bag. Also a little bit pricey."
"loved this place, small and they don't take bookings but worth showing up with hope in your heart - for an extra £2 you can get ANY pizza as a gluten-free option and yes, yes, £2 is a lot but for once I don't mind - you get a proper base, large, the same size as everyone else and the toppings were amazing. wine was good, staff were friendly, the restaurant is a whole two minute walk maximum from the tube... go there!"
i live not far away from the restaurant and ive tried another indian on ladbroke grove which was awful but Palkis is THEE best even the delivery guys are so friendly and kind upon delivering. The food always tastes wholesome fresh n yummy flavours and it doesnt taste at all processed or frozen etc Its delicious - i recommend Chicken Biriyani and it also comes with a sauce n veg mix on the side also the Chicken Rogan Josh is lovely and packs a little kick to it also. The only negative i have is the outside of the restaurant could do with a refurb to make it more enticing and uptodate. But i swear if you try it you will keep going back. I never found a hair once so the other dude on review here must of had bad luck.
"Was recommended this place by my sister for a place we could meet up and have some drinks.Cocktails pack a punch and they are carefully made. Menu is plentiful, and if you like the whole rugged beat-down underground cocktail bar vibe, and you are near Shaftesbury Avenue check it out.Well worth a visit"
"Had such a lovely afternoon tea there, really good selection of sandwiches tea and pastries. The staff were excellent ready to serve your every need, we were able to take cakes we didn't eat home in a box.Arrived early so had time to walk around kennsington park"
Friendly locals and staff give this pub a good atmosphere. A bit pricey but it is in London. Food looked good but didn't try it.
"Absolutely ridiculously small portion sizes. Ordered the bangkok king prawn stir fry at £10.95 and it was so small when he put it down on the table i thought he made a mistake and brought me a starter. It was so small they can't even put it on a full sized plate it arrives in a small dessert bowl, terrible. It was so bland and tasteless. I couldn't believe i got burnt not only on the quantity but also the quality it was seriously void of any tatse. Also ordered the soft shell crab, another joke of a portion at £10, we got 2 and a half pieces of overly stinking fish it was awful it smelt off to be honest, all I got from it was thick batter and the stink of rotten fish. This place is a disgrace, Busaba is really going down hill with its quality of food and it's portion sizes I will never return to another Busaba eathai again and I will make it a mission to let other people know to stay away from this place as ive noticed this isn't the only branch serving up terrible food with terrible quantities for high prices. Please stay away as you will be leaving hungry and with a light wallet."
Amazing tasty pie that you can nver eat!!! My boyfriend tried almost all of them and there are all delicious!!Everytime we have a guest we Always let them taste Tom's cusine!! We really enjoy Tom's pie and we always choose him place for a good Irish dinner :)
"This place was a recommendation from another restaurant as we got there after their kitchen was closed. This pub is what I think of when I think of a British Pub - small, a little dark and old feeling, a few beers on tap and really hearty, stick to your bones food. I think this was a step up from normal pub food though. My husband got the burger which seemed to be made of very high quality meat and came with really yummy chips. I got the lamb shank pie... Oh my goodness... There are no words, but I can try. Lamb shank was perfectly cooked and the mash topping was golden crusted and rich with amazing gravy underneath. It was also served with vegetable which appeared to only be lightly steamed which ive found hard to come by in England. Not to mention we had an incredible Scotch Egg to start. Perfectly cooked with just the right amount of pork on the outside. Beer was great as well. As mentioned, only a few choices, but mostly local selection and a good variety. I loved the decor and how it tied in the history of the local area. Again, one of my favorite meals from our two weeks in London"
"When you arrange to meet friends and a restaurant advertises on it's website it's open till 11pm, just because it's a little quiet, they close their kitchen at 9.45 (that's when we Arrived), it sort of ruins your evening. The manager didn't really care and told me the website was wrong. The competition in Shoreditch is plentiful and more welcoming. I (or my friends) will not be visiting again."
Visited here and ordered from the new summer menu the salt beef with swiss cheese and mustard sandwich with fries. Absolutely loved it. Also a good atmosphere with good music inside
"This place is a good place to eat in Stratford if your looking for something different. My partner and I came on a busy Stratford Saturday at 6.00 and we only waited for 10min. They had a good waiting service were they take your number and text you when your table ready which I think was very handy.My Partner and I shared the 'wings and Tings platter' and a side of brisket to share. Just one annoying thing. I wish the waitresses would of told us our wings platter came with drinks, because £2.90 EACH just for a glass of lemonade I could of done without and saved. Other then that the food was really nice, love that you can taste the smoke from the smoker and the service was nice. Would 100% go again"
"Booked the Charlie and the Chocolate factory themed afternoon tea for teenage nephew and 2 adults. No-one is too old to enjoy this! Outstanding. The menu was absolutely no run-of-the-mill afternoon tea : spectacular, delicious, innovative and the attention to detail was brilliant. The service was immaculate too - friendly without ever being stuffy. Highly recommended. Just wondering when we can all do it again....!"
Paddington Railway Station. The manager and staff over stressed. I will not be returning.Unfortunate experience. My request to cut a horrible sandwich into quarters ignored. Sorry. Apart from that it was OK. I got some highly overpriced food for which I am none the less grateful. This is the first and last time I have ever complained about anything anywhere in my life.The week before was great.
"On our last night in London we wanted to go somewhere spectacular and we were not let down. Amazing menu, food, service, atmosphere and not really expensive, this is a unique wonderful place to visit for special occasions, or often if you can. The food was so beautifully presented and very delicious. We had 4 courses and a bottle of wine. The staff were professional, courteous at all times, and very thorough. They remained aware of our tight timescale but we were not rushed in any way. Our needs were more than catered for. Definitely one of the better restaurants ive been to. Could not have asked for a better meal to end our first trip to London. Goes without saying that on our next visit, we will be returning."
"Had a wonderful meal at this restaurant. The staff were excellent, especially the barman who made superb cocktails. Would highly recommend a visit."
Had a great evening here. Lively place for me and OH to enjoy. Loads of cocktails to choose from. Crowd not too young and no queueing at the bar either. Table service. Bonus.
"Arrived to be met by a couple of front of house girls who did not seem to be doing much - but it still took at least a minute for them to greet us properly then there was a flurry of staff but again a minute or so pause while they got round to showing us to the table.This was on a corner, in next to a staff only store cupboard and the high chairs - not exactly restful.There was an overpowering aroma of incense throughout the resistant - almost as if they were trying to dull your taste buds. Starters were very good but the chicken curry was inedible. Tough, gristly meat and a bland sauce. Very disappointing and even though the waiter who cleared it could see I'd hardly touched it, he did not ask if it had been alright. A glass of wine was £11! Overall, very disappointing and we won't be going back."
My husband and I had lunch here and it was lovely. The staff could not have been more helpful friendly and pleasant. As the oldest restaurant in London it has a certain idiosyncratic ambience. The food was enjoyable without being outstanding. All in all pleasurable experience.
Very nice and warm service. Pizzas were excellent and can recommend'em Any time. I definetly will be back!!
"the food was good... but not the staff, they are not enough for the customers! and the sommelier hasn't a experience to open a bottle of wine! :( the place is very comfortable! maybe i ll come back!"
"Friendly local bar located in High Street offering beers, spirits and cocktails. Friendly staff. Highly recommended."
"First time with a hotel in Plimlico and we stumble op on this great reaturant. We ate there two nights in a row. Great food, very good tea and handsome staff!"
Call me old fashioned but after being directed to sit at the bar and then have to listen to a fellow patron constantly dropping the f word I couldn't finish my drink fast enough and then leave.
"great service and great food. very pleasent place to relax and eat. staff very good and attentive. we had drinks in the bar a meal with wine and bottles of beer, the bill for 4 of us came to £45. very good i thought."
"I was here on Friday for a friends birthday and I have to say how disappointed I was, the food , the atmosphere and most of all the service !The service was appalling we was sat down for 20 mins before we even got the waiters attention for a drink, it then took long enough for that to come, we had all easily gone through the menu a few times so was ready to order which we thought we would do when we get our drinks, they then wanted to rush off again, we managed to order bread, to which was slammed on the table before they ran off again !Ordering food was such hard work and the waiter was completely impolite, questioned the amount off food as ordered and was very sarcastic, forgot one of our dishes and again slammed all the food down on the table, I actually felt like walking out because of their rudeness. You can never get their attention !Food- not good at all, the meat was dry and over cooked. I will never go back there again it was just hard workTo add insult to the sham of a night they put a silly service charge on the bill, they should have paid us !Avoid this overpriced bad service restaurant, save some money and go to la tasca!"
Loved this diner. We were looking for a place to have breakfast before a long drive. Left our belongings in the car in a nearby parking garage. The place had plenty of seating. The staff was patient and very polite and helpful. The food was really good. Eve though I was full I had to finish. Highly recommended.
"My BF bought an Amazon offer, Lobster burger and half bottle of wine, we eventually made it here! I know the place for drinks but still hadn't eaten. A treat it was too...Lobster burger - original and sinful, fries, I think the best fries I have ever eaten and let's face it how many fries across the world have we all eaten! Delicious, great ambiance, good service and Amazon offer a bargain!"
Had a business event here and expected 'mass produced meals' with bland flavours!! I was wrong!! Really lovely food - very tasted and friendly hard working staff.Fantastic views of London and the Thames just added to the quality.
My wife and I visited after a tiring walk on Portobello Road. We ordered the classic burgers with sweet potato fries lemonade and a cider. Totally enjoyed it. It was the best lemonade ive tasted. The burger was awesome.
"Nicely tucked away, the courtyard was potentially excellent. Shame about the Christmas tree and false snow on the hedges. Has nobody told them that Christmas finished weeks ago. Food is okay but just okay. Certainly well worth a visit with the Open-table discount. Don't think it's worth menu prices."
"great cocktails money balanced....staff super friendly, atmosphere smart .....a place to go when in Hoxton Square."
"Came for the free gin evening - which was a real tonic (geddit) - and stayed for the food. Two shared 2 small plates with chips and it was enough for us. Yum. Fish cakes were just right, with that Italian cabbage (nero?) a perfect contrast. Loved the grilled leg of lamb with fresh beans. Fave was the chips: best ive had in ages, from fresh potatoes. Efficient, friendly staff. And finished with recommended bittersweet beer made with fruit, called Pogo."
"Superb food, staff friendly and helpful. Quite busy on arriveal being Bank Holiday weekend but had drink in bar area then shown to table"
We enjoyed a simple meal here. Ambience was more upscale but prices reasonable for London. The risotto was especially good. Would recommend.
Visited for a late night dinner. The peach and goat cheese salad was not good - peaches were lacking flavour and the dish was very disappointing. The falafel though was excellent. The lamb in the Lamb shwarma was excellent although the bread was disappointing. My third visit here - hopefully it was an aberration and the food improves on my next visit.
"We didn't know about the Python connection before visiting so that was a little bonus. Apparently they used to meet there, drink lots of beer and write their scripts. There is a little 'shrine' for Graham Chapman. The beer is good, lovely roast lunch reasonably priced. Staff helpful and service good. Very convenient for visit to Highgate Cemetery."
"Wonderful menu, with emphasis on season. Great game, in a very, very, traditional setting. I was slightly hesitant about visiting as I'd imagined a quite 'snooty' reception, but was not the case at all, very friendly and enthusisastic staff.Not cheap, but worth pushing the boat out for a special occasion."
"Went with my best friend to this nice-looking restaurant, in the heart of the Govent Gdn. Very friendly smiling guy seated us to very nice table. At that time there were just beside the restaurant some street entertainment going on, makes the feeling even better. Took a pizza with some extras, there were no problems. This nice girl even gave me some more details about toppings. Pizza was very nice, good traditional Italian pizza. My friend liked her salmon too, very very very nice..!! Staff was awesome, took care of us whole time."
"I came with my family to celebrate my son's 18 Birthday. It was our second party after the main one...just for family. As expected we had a lovely time, great service and food. My mum tried first time one of the white wines which they sell only by bottles...I don't remember the name now but I do remember that my mum ordered for us second bottle...it was so delicious."
"The food looked great. They seated us, then neglected us. After they served several tables that Arrived after us, we left."
"Honestly just have any type of past, they are all great! Amatriciana and carbonara definitely for a first try! The service is a bit slow so you might find yourself drinking a lot of wine!!!"
"I always make a stop at Rules, if even just for a pudding and coffee, anytime I am in London. For dinner try one of the wild game entrees - venison, pheasant, boar, etc."
"Hello, i went to Franco Manca with my other half after hearing so many good reviews about it we had to try it for our selves to see how good it really was. We had one pepperoni pizza and one spicy lamb pizza, now i found that the pepperoni pizza was a lot better then the lamb one,not saying that lamb one was horrible but i thought the pieces of lamb were to chunky and should have been smaller just like minced lamb inced of meatballs kind of thing going on, you get more lamb on the pizza when it is properly minced. But the pepperoni pizza was really good and both pizzas had a decent base and over all very good yummy pizza. Service was goo the guy was friendly and the waitresses were good to...You must go there if you like pizza."
"I have been going to this restaurant since it first opened, and now live over 20 miles away but still go back when I can. The Chicken Kukra is my favourite and I must have had it over 100 times (we used to eat there once a week). I can honestly say I have had a bad meal there twice in the whole time I have been. I celebrated my 30th there, have taken my 2 week old daughter in and have had countless celebratory meals. The service is always first class and it is impeccably clean. Nothing is too much effort and the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. I really can't rate this highly enough."
"I was part of a group of a party of ten men at a recent visit to Polpo in Cowcross recently. We spent five hours at the restaurant enjoying a wonderful selection of Italian plates, which satisfied everyone's taste. In the kaos, a few dishes had been placed in front of the wrong diner, but without arguement, the waitress replaced the dishes with a smile. We did not get rushed and enjoyed a wonderful experience. I have dined at the Covent Garden and Beak St. Polpo, but vote this branch as my favorite. The food was cooked to perfection and the wine was a perfect compliment. If you haven't visited Polpo yet, you have been missing a very exciting new eating experience!"
After visiting here 4 times now i feel obliged to write a review and let you know how yummy the food is...!The restaurant is hidden at the back of Lancaster Gate and Paddington along a row of other restaurants and a couple of shops. Decor is old fashioned and french which adds to the atmosphere of being in a little Parisian side street. I always skip starters (Steak is filling enough) but they do look good...I have had the steak and grilled fish here but the succelent steak and pepper sauce here is to keel over for!. Sublime.Staff are always freindly and never really had to wait for service unlike some of the chain restaurants.The restaurant tends to get busy in the evenings from around 8pm so get there early or book (if you can?).Father Micheal....Ill see you soon!.PS: The window seats are great to watch the world go by!
"A very popular restaurant the bar area always looks full. We booked just to make sure we could get a table. To our relief there were a few tables left in the down stairs section. The waiters were very friendly, attentive and helpful as we made our selections. We were not rushed and had a very relaxed time. I have found in Tapas style restaurants the food comes very fast and it's hard to stretch out the evening, but not here. The food and wine were excellent and well-priced. I would definitely book here again."
"We came here because we followed the recommendation of time out cheap eats. However after only a few minutes we could see that the menu was quite expensive. Thinking that this was because the restaurant was vegan and organic, and must therefore serve food of a high quality, we decided to give it a try anyway. We ordered two menus to share, a sushi menu and the ""new"" tempura menu. Unfortunately the sushi was of a very low quality, with a piece of red bell pepper as the sole topping on one of teh nigiri. The same went for the tempura. There was almost no vegetable in neither of both dishes. This would have been fine if we had been charged appropriately, but we paid £53,70 for what was almost only rice. We left the place starving and thinking we have should have followed our gut feel and left before ordering. Would not go again and would not recommend."
Loved the pink decor everywhere and the pop-up benefit makeup shop below. Great place for delicious lunch and bubbly with friends. Eat inside if the weather is wet or situp on the deck when the sun shines. A lovely treat by the Thames.
"So great to discover a new local that does the type of food we want to eat and with a really buzzy family atmosphere too and friendly staff . faultless . Large generous starters ; lots of vegetarian choices , would recommend both the mozzarella with roasted vegetables and the asparagus and radicchio salad . Plus lovely pastas, fresh tomato sauce spaghetti was just what was needed on a cold wet summers day . The specials from the neighbouring tables ; fresh artichoke and various fish all looks delicious too . Plus lovely coffee [ having eaten over weekend at Scotts in Mayfair over weekend and been disappointed by their prices and lack of charm] , this gave a perfect end to the bank holiday weekend ."
"The waiters have no idea what they're doing. Upon arriveal the table was filthy and dirty, the food came staggered, extremely late."
5 of 5 stars
"We came for an Afternoon Tea without reservation. The extremely polite staff guided us to the bar to wait, and soon invited us to the upstairs gallery where a sofa table became free.The interior was something else, service very attentive everything just delicious, and there was plenty to eat! A unique experience well worth the high price."
"This is a pub on the first floor of the Innkeeper's Lodge Hotel, which is wrongly given as ""The Mitre"" in booking.com and other Internet sites. Pleasant atmosphere, live music some evenings. Standard British pub, recommended!"
"Small very friendly restaurant situated on Finchley Road. Staff, food and atmosphere excellent. Extensive menu, Great value for money. Highly recommended."
"Been here twice for lunch, both times the food was diveine. The prices aren't too unreasonable and the dim sum are to die for, particularly the duck yolk custard buns. The servers are lovely and attentive and the atmosphere is just right. Cannot recommend it highly enough."
"A busy restaurant right in the middle of Covent Garden, took me a while to get this place but everything is British!, really clever, the Pizza I had was British cheese and slow cooked brisket, fantastic, highly recommend."
"After visiting Kensington Palace, we went to tea at the Park Terrace. My daughter had been to the restaurant that was on another level. She thought that we would be overlooking the Kensington Palace grounds. But tea was served on the lower level. It was still nice, with attentive service. A quiet place. Many choices for types of tea. The staff was unusually friendly, especially since we had changed our reservation time and they had no record of the change."
Ate at the branch in Russell and Pancras Stations. Delicious chicken sandwich with avocado. Great find : the ginger shot with apple juice.I just don't understand why dining and to go or take away is priced differently.
"We went there at 4 am due to its 24 hours service. A guy came to us while we were standing on the queue, he said we need to pay £1000 to book a table!? Of course we went another place after that answer..."
"Within easy reach of Whitehall and the West End, Gaby's is still the place for me when I want falafel. A box of 2 falafel on homemade humus with 3 salad choices is all you need to set you up for the day. And if not, there is a;ways a massive piece of baklava with your name on it!The prices are higher for a sit-down meal, but then again, the commercial rent must be astronomical so I don't begrudge them that. Long may it last :-)"
"After two fantastic evenings, one at Jamie's Italian in Newcastle another in York we were looking forward to visiting branches in London.We pre-booked for a party of 6 at Jamie's Italian in Piccadilly and were greeted with the words ""you've got an hour and then I need the table for another booking"". Literally the first words for a dinner booking. The waitress told us to ignore the reception boy and we enjoyed the evening.Another day we tried Union Jacks for lunch. We were asked if the high table was OK, which was fine. However, this only gave us a better viewing point to watch two chefs arguing. Five consecutive waiting staff ignored us or went to get somebody to take our order. After 20 minutes we left, hungry and disappointed. Thankfully, the brilliantly welcoming Carluccios had space.The food, ambience and staff of the regional restaurants is great, but ive been put off trying any of the London branches ever again."
"Strangely enough, while we were surrounded by wonderful produce from all over Europe in Borough Market, this only seemed to make us want an English breakfast all the more. So, when we spotted Maria's Market Cafe, we were delighted!It didn't look impressive to us from the outside, but we saw that there were plenty of people eating there and also popping in to grab a takeaway roll and a cup of tea. We thought that was a very good sign so we decided to have a look at the menu. We were pleased to see that toast, bacon, egg and sausage was available, along with that British classic, bubble and squeak.So we went for it, and we were pleasantly surprised by the friendly service and the well cooked, good quality food. Maybe we shouldn't have been so surprised, though, as we noticed later on that the market insists on certain standards from all who operate there.Anyway, the bacon was delicious, the eggs were lovely and the bubble was excellent. Although the plastic seats could have been a bit more comfortable, and the tables were squeezed together a bit, we were very pleased with our breakfast overall. Well done, Maria's!"
Last night myself and three of my friends visited Chicago Rib Shack. On entrance we were greeted with a great warming smile from the ever so lovely Angus who kept us happy and entertained the whole night through.I have visited this restaurant a number of times and I find with each visit my experience gets better. Ribs were absolutely delicious and my strawberry mojito was probably the best I have tasted till date.
"Lovely first time to shard with delicious food and service, felt very surreal and my grandparents loved it and felt like royalty"
"I took my other half here for our anniversary, we had the bookatable deal for lobster and steak which was excellent value for money but there are also other deals on as well. The restaurant was beautiful, staff were all very friendly, lobster was tasty but the steak was amazing. Really delicious. I'm not a gambler but the casino looked fun if you like that sort of thing. Would go back to the restaurant again."
"We came to The Ship as jet lagged travelers from the USA. We were shown an excellent menu and the person in charge made suggestions. The meal was made complete by a visit from the Pub cat, Mao (Chairman ""Mow""). This place is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood, I will return."
i went twice herei the fish and chips they offerand like to sit outside the meal nice and prices not bad
"We had a pre Show lunch here on a day out from the West Country. The service was excellent. Our waiter was friendly and assisted my husband who has walking difficulties. The food was quickly served even though the restaurant was busy. We both selected a Pasta dish which was well prepared and very tasty. It was also very hot. We both enjoyed a glass of wine recommended by the waiter. For an excellent pre theatre meal this was very reasonably priced. We will visit again. If you like Italian, well worth a visit."
"We enjoyed late breakfasts here with family on very busy Saturday and Sunday mornings in early April. We have eaten in a number of Cote restaurants - breakfast, lunch and dinner and the are generally very good, and offer great value. There is an excellent breakfast menu, including gluten free options. Our only issue was that the service was not as professional as it usually is at Cote and there seemed to be a difficulty in getting toast served at the same time as our breakfasts - this happened on both mornings - and delays in milk/sugar for teas. Having said that we would definitely return as the breakfasts are top quality and fantastic value."
"If you go around notting hill, you have to stop by Cocotte, its ideal for dinner with friends, i would recomanded everybody to share everything as all their dishes are super tasty, DONT miss out their truffle Mac and Cheese"
"Good service but disappointed with the chicken, which should have been breast meat but was definitely a cheaper, less appealing variety. This let down the chicken satay and chicken curry. Clearly trying to save money but I probably won't be back ...."
We have visited this restaurant before and it is never disappoints. We tend to use clubcard vouchers towards the cost of food but I think it's worth the money even at full price. Staff are welcoming but professional. Food is fresh with generous portions.
"My experience of this restaurant was fabulous! It's family run business by Antonio who is the head chef, the food is freshly cooked pasta so it was worth waiting for the food. I recently went here to celebrate my aunt's birthday, it's in a excellent location close to Finsbury tube so it's within walking distance. You'll be greeted with warm welcome by the owners, excellent service throughout your meal and good value for your moneyI would definitely recommend this restaurant for family dinners or perhaps meal for 2."
Dimt is a smart and designed restaurant with good service and dishes. Upper priceclass for asian food but without being expensive. The pad thai was great and well worth the price. Service was good and fast allthough with small misstakes. Don't miss out on the chocolate bento box!
"I visited Boundary last night as a friend has a fetish for rooftop bars. I wasn't as keen given it was late autumn in London but thought it was worth a whirl. We were immediately sat next to an open fire that just wasn't workign properly. It wasn't lit right or the chimney wasn't working because it was just smoking the place out (my clothes still smell) so we moved next to one of their ineffective gas heaters. My drinks order as taken wrong but I'll give the benefit of the doubt that I wasn't clear enough. That all said, the staff were friendly, they provide rugs and the view is pretty special, especially as you watch the light dissapear over London town,. Small classy drinks menu and a small food slection. This place would rock in summer. Fact!"
Booked this restaurant for my husbands birthday. The food is fabulous and the service first rate. Very nice atmosphere and situated right next to Stamford Bridge stadium. We will definitely return.
Extremely expensive and very Average food and service. Can have and do better at home. For such a special place and building such a disappointment.
"Food was okay and fairly priced although would've enjoyed slightly more toppings on pizza. Dessert was ice cream which was cheap ice cream with a hefty price tag. Service was the worst, they were friendly to me but came across as standoffish, I spent my entire meal listening to them hang out in the back and not actually work and when I wanted to bill I actually couldn't get anyone's attention. On top they had a forced service charge which normally I don't mind paying, as a waitress myself I think service charge is important but to get it you need actual service. Would recommend takeaway but ask for extra toppings for sure!"
"Quirky little pub tucked away behind Barbican station, landlord/owner always polite and friendly, decent sized portions and reasonably priced. Never seems to be busy so if you're looking for somewhere you're almost guaranteed to get a table for a quiet lunchtime catch up I would say to give this a try. Nothing fancy by any means, but you get what you pay for - and the goats cheese tart is always a winner, very generous on the goats cheese. They do limited menu adjustments for food allergies (items removed, but not items added). Wish I was able to give a 3.5/5 rating because it needs to be a bit more lively to get a 4/5."
"We dropped in here for a cup of tea/coffee on Easter Satuday. No decaff coffee, nothing but full fat milk. That's cool, you're coffee purists, but perhaps don't set yourselves up as a cafe then, since people effectively only have one choice?I had a cup of tea, served without milk or sugar and nothing to put my tea bag in. We sat on stools at the counter, since the rest of the tables were being prepared for the lunch service. We were admonished by the barista (well, the guy behind the counter) to leave room for people to get to the counter to order takeaways.The Aussie barista was rude and arrogant. As people came in his first interaction was always, we're closing soon to finish preparing for the lunch service so you can only have a takeaway. As soon as they opened the door, he went straight into his spiel. Quite amusing when someone responded that they had actually wanted to book a table for lunch.Everything about the barista's attitude was offputting and we got to see it by being sat at the counter. The food may be lovely but I wouldn't go back to try it having seen the service. If you don't want to accommodate people for tea and coffee that's fine, but don't say you do tea/coffee then be totally inflexible and patronising about it."
"We were running late, so our friend who got there on time waited next door in the pub. Tom, our gracious host, made a point of popping next door to check that she was all right, and gently told us off for keeping suc a charming lady waiting. The food was fantastic - as if we were eating the best pie in the worlds in someone's liveing room somewhere in Ireland. Our friend had the lamb shank, her gravy was fantastic, there were enough (properly cooked) vegetables to keep a small country going for a week, Tom was funny and charming, it was one of the nicest nights out imaginable. Highly recommended. Remember to book. Oh, and try and avoid Sunday lunch - I'd hate not to be able to get a table just because I gave the place a good review!"
"We called for lunch and had difficulty choosing from the excellent menu. I had Barnsley Lamb Chops and Kidneys in the end, after an amazing soup called Cauliflower Cheese Soup with dumplings. We ordered extra vegetables which were beautifully al dente. Service was excellent too.Only complaint, no complimentary bread or rolls and no jug of iced tap water available. Also no soft furnishings meant one end of the restaurant was very noisy. However, when we asked about this we were moved politely to the other end near the bar, where it was carpeted which meant is was a lot quieter."
"This restaurant located in Brixton is worth the visit. some of our friends reserved a table with the greatest difficulty on a Tuesday evening and recommend that we ""The Lamb Tan Tan Men"" Ramen - it was fantastic. really there's no words to describe how happy and pleasantly surprised !!its a must to be visited if you are a ""foody"" and I highly recommend the ""Ramen Lamb Tan Tan Men"" this was clearly the best and it comes in good portions. for starters try the Ten-Pepper Prawns and the Beef Tataki. - it certainly has so much flavours. good portions. the restaurant is operated by Tim Anderson who is a Masterchef winner - the restaurant is a real winner as well. staff and service was great, ambience pretty good."
"Good coffee, very reasonably priced too! Fantastic and very fresh sandwiches. friendly and quick service too.Just wish there was a branch in Perth Westen Australia!"
Had dinner there on Thursday eve. As I had never been there I wasn't sure what to expect but I was very nicely surprised! The staff was really friendly and the food was fresh and really delicious
"Food was quite nice - as expected. They cooked our steaks the wrong way round - mine was well done instead of being medium rare and my partners was medium rare when he had asked for well done.They forgot to bring us the bearnaise sauce completely and only brought the spinach when we asked them. When we told them about the mistakes there was no apology or acknowledgement - we were just told he would let the chef know!!!For the amount you pay I was very disappointed in the service and missing food and will certainly not be going back to this restaurant.Also, my partner had to ask for more wine from our bottle as he'd been sitting for 5 minutes with an empty glass."
Had lunch here with a friend recently. Inexpensive (considering the location) and pleasant food; I had spicy pork and with and miso soup. Would visit again if passing.
"We had booked a deal through bookatable that covered afternoon tea and free flowing champagne for two hours.As there were four of us, we chose a combination of hot and cold options.The food Arrived and was tasty and there was more than enough so come hungry.Champagne was nice, we could have easily drank more than we received (occasionally staff could not be seen, leading me to think they were indirectly rationing the fizz). The service, was at times slow but the staff were perfectly pleasant.All in all, we had a fun afternoon and the grill is rather close to Oxford Street so you could move on to shop til you drop or launch into the West End social scene."
"I notice that whilst the prices are reasonable they charge £3 per person for Chinese tea which is way expensive. Tea is one of the cheapest beverage and if they continue doing this I am not going back, a more reasonable price would be £1. Having said that the food is good and fresh."
"Tom was an absolutely wonderful host who made us all laugh. Importantly he also cooks a fabulous dinner, the lamb shank melted in your mouth it was so good! The food was home cooked and portions were plentiful. Prices were very reasonable :) It's a little tricky to get to if you're not in East London, but it's worth a journey and if I lived nearer to Greenwich I'd be a regular visitor!"
"We visited little frankies recently and the customer service was excellent and the food was lovely, we where seated quickly and served immediately with drinks and the food came just as quick, no one rushed us to finish and we where asked if everything was OK, which it was. We all had ice cream sundaes which where packed with a lot of ingredients and we carried on our journey around London fed and watered."
"Yes it IS mums and kids central but lunch time seems to be more adult so tried it yesterday with a friend (I think we were the only men there!) Really enjoyed the poached egg with smoked salmon on sourdough toast and service was friendly and efficient. When I got up to leave I couldn't find my hat anywhere and the staff suggested I leave my tel number in case they found it. Next morning I got a phone call for me to collect lost hat. In this busy city where this kind of thoughtfulness seems in short supply, I was VERY impressed and grateful. Thanks guys ... and that's why I'll be back."
"Sunday morning meant a visit to Bear and Wolf with my friends who claimed that this will be the best bacon sandwich experience of my life...they were not wrong! I opted for the bacon sandwich - streaky bacon, avocado, aioli, roasted cherry tomatoes on onion brioche. This was absolutely delicious, perfect mixture of salty bacon, sweet onion brioche and creamy avocado. I also had a pretty damn good flat white. Lovely family friendly atmosphere, we were the only group here without children!"
"We had spent a busy day seeing various things and had not eaten since breakfast. Having one of the cookbooks we popped in to try it and it was superb. Very tast, very filling and very fresh. Just what we needed to give us an injection of energy. Will now try the book"
"We had a family lunch here. The service was fine, if a little on the slow side - the staff were friendly and attentive and were extremely helpful. The food was also very good. Well cooked, well presented and very generous portions, but the prices, even by Hampstead standards, were, in my view, extremely high.In particular, I thought the prices on the wine list were ridiculously high. All in all, though, a very pleasant experience and one that I would happily repeat."
"Make sure you head here for a Sunday roast, one of the most delicious roast dinners I have ever had besides my mums!We usually come here once a month for an afternoon meal, and we are usually greeted with the bad news that they have sold out of the lamb roast - I have had the lamb once and it was amazing so make sure you go early if you want to try it!The staff are very friendly, especially the Australian girl who we always seem to serve us. She is always very polite and willing to provide suggestions on the beers on offer, which incidentally they have a fantastic range of micro-brewery beers. There is also a Canadian/American guy who we have had the pleasure of having him serve us, as he is very friendly.All in all the roasts here are great, some of the best in London I believe. They might not be the cheapest but they are definitely some of the best so make sure you give the Princess a go."
"R.S. Hispaniola (Restaurant Ship) is moored on the River Thames, very close to the Embankment Underground Station and opposite The Wheel & London Aquarium. A family lunch was booked for my birthday, high chairs were provided for the grandchildren with a good view of the Thames & Wheel. The staff were friendly & helpful. The food was very good & a great time was had by all - Thanks"
"We dropped by for a quick lunch. The restaurant is a small family run business. The staff were all very attentive and nice. We all had the special consisting of fish, chips, side salad, and a drink. We had the cod fish, it was perfectly done and excellent tasting. The chips and salad were also yummy but the fish is the highlight. We would highly recommend this restaurant!"
"Had a fantastic dinner with a couple of friends hadn't seen for a while. They have nice selections of drink and food lists. It was nice and warm in the restaurant. Friendly service. Considering the quality of food and drink you get, the bill is very reasonable."
"I celebrated my birthday at this restaurant last Saturday. We have visited the restaurant on a couple of occasions and as always it was superb. Great menu, beautifully cooked and presented food and the service was faultless. It was a real treat and the staff make you feel very special. Thank you so much. Hope to return soon."
If you're looking for some great service and an excellent burger head to Elliots across from Black and Bleu (which may have some of the worst service ive ever experienced). We had a lovely lunch away from the street eats in Borough Market and will absolutely be back on our next visit. Thanks guys!
"This pub has a great atmosphere, friendly staff and good beer. The food is really good. We had the steak and ale pie, and chilli con carne. Both were delicious"
The food is wannabe USA. Steak was good. The side plates were average... But adding without saying 10 percent to my bill is not done. (looking to much to the US?)
"Good cheap chicken, service is limited and you cannot order from your table but i'm used to that from home anyway."
"I live locally and I dined here after many months of walking past it. The menu seemed interesting and we went on a Sunday night with a booking. We were given seats at the bar and we ordered an assortment of tapas to share. I am sorry to say that the food we had was the poorest in the area. Two of our dishes were cold and the remainder tasted like they were microwave heated leftovers from the night before.Add to that there was a mysterious charge of 10% on the bill which seemed to creep its way on which takes one star off this booking. We ate here with a friend who is in London for the first time and I was embarrassed we were out of there in 45 minutes. There are plenty of other good restaurants in the Pimlico/Victoria area that serve real food, try somewhere else."
Cheap and quick! Always served with a smile although could be a little less noisy so they can hear what I say. Would be good if you always provided a holder and not a serviette without asking every day!
"My wife and I Arrived early in London for a theatre night out. We wanted to look around, chill, and then have a bite to eat first. Being regular visitors to London, sadly we quite often find poor value in all respects, particularly with eating out; overpriced, indifferent food and poor service.We now think that Cote, within easy walking distance of Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery, Portrait Gallery and numerous theatres, has now ticked all the boxes for us !Mid week, early evening, customers were almost hanging out the doors. Not surprisingly, with a la carte and pre-theatre dining menus at sensible prices. The place is clean, has a great ambience and brimming with attentive waiters who really want to give you proper service. We had the pre-dinner set meal, and it was excellent in all respects plus the French wine was well above average for the price....and then there was the lovely French accents.....sorry I'm a male!There is no doubt that we will eat there again, and we look forward to trying the rest of the menu. We rate this restaurant very highly."
"A lovely little restaurant in this little village-y corner just off Edgeware Road. Super modern decor, a couple of table in the street for those balmy evenings.The menu is a little more interesting than most, spinach souffle went down very well, baby squid with balsamic reduction, Tartare di Salmone was refreshing although could have done with a bit more salmon. Standard bruschetta was one of the best, very tasty.We stuck with pasta, linguine pomodoro and a penne with salmon were both rated very highly. A linguine with pesto and prawns as good but not quite as successful as it should have been.The tiramisu was gorgeous. Next time I will have the Chocolate Souffle.Overall a very good meal and much more of the menu to explore.Highly recommended."
"I brought my mother to London for the day to treat her to a champagne afternoon tea. As I usually take tea at the Intercontinental Westminster (with free flowing champagne) I decided to have a change and the Reform Social and Grill looked appealing, particularly as it also offers free flowing champagne. I made a booking around 6 weeks in advance via afternoontea.co.uk which was confirmed via telephone the day prior to arriveal. So far so good!On arriveal 15 minutes earlier than our booked time we were not greeted right away as I'd expected and instead we found ourselves presenting our reservation at the bar. The bar staff sent us up to the restaurant, where we were told to ""Wait here. She is just coming."" We then presented our reservation again and were directed to our booth, which had been kindly reserved for us. The area was quiet, with music in the background but no pianist (which is essential with afternoon tea isn't it??). The overall decor felt a little like a seedy Dublin bar with its brown leather seats, slightly darkened decor and large pictures but I 'got' it to an extent-its obviously meant to be modelled on an olde worlde, Cuban gentlemans club but its not to my taste personally. I felt rather disheartened at the chunky crockery and cups and the lack of tablecloths too. I like to see dainty china and white table linen for afternoon tea personally. Ever the ladies, my mother decided that we should go for 'half an half' plumping for the gentlemans afternoon tea out of curiosity and the vintage afternoon tea, which we shared between us. It was all brought out to us worryingly quickly and with barely any time to enjoy our champagne cocktails and as I then had to request a glass of 'free flowing' champagne I got the gist that they were not eager to part with the champagne at all. In regards to the gentlemans afternoon tea which consisted of a slice of sausage roll, a mini burger and a piece of steak on a crispbread (but no sign of the advertised snail sadly) it was all very nice and I have no complaints. It actually made a nice change to sandwiches to be quite honest! The sandwiches were sadly not up to scratch. The beetroot bread was dry, the basil bread tasted salty and the fillings were very sparse. The scones were very nice, served warm with a great big dollop of clotted cream and two mini jars of raspberry jam. Cakes were also plentiful-two of each and although small very delicious. Again, I felt I had to ask for every glass of 'free flowing' champagne (my mother had two, I had four glasses so it was hardly as if we were taking advantage) and the waitress didn't take too kindly to me choosing to try another flavour of the tea (I originally ordered the rosebud which was very nice but once allowed to brew it became rather bitter and so I opted for the jasmine tea) and we had to ask twice for a pot of water to refill my mothers peppermint tea. As it was my mothers first experience of afternoon tea in London I felt she enjoyed it as she had nothing else to compare it with really, but in my opinion the Mandeville could and really should try much harder. I expected a lot more from this seemingly prestigious hotel and I expected to be paying £35 per head for so much more. OK-it is London after all but I have experienced far better service, style and food elsewhere. I would possibly recommend this establishment for a more sedate stag party than a girlie afternoon tea experience and it is unlikely I shall return, sadly."
"We got a takeaway from here while visiting family in London. Food was very good, particularly the Katsu Curry, but was let down by the meagre amountof sauce. If ordering this dish, I recommend you ask for extra sauce."
"Popped in for a late lunch and we got a nice table by the window. We moved to London nearly 3 years ago and I can proudly say that I had the best GattÌ_ (baked potato cake with mortadella, Parmesan and mozzarella) since I left my country. The pizza was "" the real one"": soft base, generous amount of mozzarella and seasonings. But the outstanding dish was the Guazzetto: fresh and flavoursome mussels, clams, prawns and seabass casserole with smooth tomatoe sauce and toasted bread. Friendly and attentive service in a relaxed atmosphere. Well done guys!"
"It can be Bush and you can expect 15m queues to get a table... But forget all that.Just havÌ» fun with a good pizza, pie or steack Jamie's style.You sont be deceived. Covent Garden bohemian spirit's presente!"
"I had dinner wth Martin, Peter and Rob at Sri Thai City on Tuesday night, we had a great meal and would definetely go back. It seems like its the lunch retaurant of choice for the banking crowd, the decor was amazing and the menu was fantastic. We had the Sri Thai City Mixed Hors D'Oeuvres which includes Pandan Chicken (chicken wrapped in banana leaf), Rob and I both ate it whole... mistake, you're supposed to take the leaf off, we're both idiots. He had trouble getting it down, I had trouble getting it out. Other than that it was a great time, great meal."
"With Vietnamese being my favourite cuisine, finding the Bang Bang Canteen was a bonus.Simply decorated with a touch of style, this restaurant would be hard to find if you were taking a stroll up Tottenham Court Road.The menu has all the usual Vietnamese dishes including Pho, a beef broth soup with noodles (great on a cold day) and the ever popular Bao (soft Asian buns with various fillings).For me, the star of the show is the spicy and sticky chicken wings. With just the right amount of heat, sweetness and crunch, these are so good, I always order extra to take home. They are extra yummy cold the next day!Whether you are just passing nearby Warren Street Station or have a travel a few miles to get here, Bang Bang Canteen is well worth the trip!"
The food is so over priced and i would enjoy my meal more if id of got a microwave pizza from asda than the wet soggy one i recieved today. The soup was more like water with floating vegetables and the service was awful. She did not listen and tried to charge us for a gammon steak we never even ordered !!!!! Never returning !!!
"I love going here with my mates after work when wanting something cheap but yummy and fresh! If you aren't early there is a long wait. However depending on which one you go to, they let you buy drinks in the line. Recommend for a casual meal with mates"
"I was involved in arranging a large dinner for over 120 guests, and booked the dinner on the Hispaniola, together with the upper deck for before and after dinner drinks. We all had a fantastic evening - the food and wine was very good, and the staff serving us were very friendly and accommodating. I received many appreciative comments from the diners - they really enjoyed the meal and the superb scenic setting.It could not have gone any better."
"I love a well-run restaurant with great food. The meat is always excellent as you'd expect but the burgers are the best in London. Sides are also excellent. Not cheap sadly and the wine is very fully priced. Great setting and charming, engaged staff. I have gone along to this restaurant very regularly over the last three or four years and it has always been an excellent experience. Please keep delivering. Much appreciated!"
We ordered a chicken dish was suppose to be like meat balls. We were served one chicken leg. The portions were fit for sparrows. Meanwhile we heard them laughing in the kitchen . Feeling vulnerable as we were the only ones in we didn't complain . Horrible experience . Be warned.
Booked using a Timeout offer of 4 courses Petit fours and a cocktail- simply the best fine dining experience to date. Our server Khulan was friendly attentive but importantly unobtrusive throughout.Every course of food was of the highest quality standard and presentation and the highlight for me was the desserts we had the royal trio.... And the cheesecake with a lemon& coriander composite was unreservedly the best desserts we have ever had. We will certainly return with or without an offer.
I never been before and had the chicken katsu curry. was lovely and a large portion too x will go again
"After collecting my takeaway pizza and opening it back at my hotel room it was instantly apparent that I had been given the wrong pizza. No biggie, a quick phone call and an apology and my new pizza was cooking as I returned, on foot, with the wrong order. When I Arrived at Ibleo the staff again apologized and took my order to the door of the kitchen so the chef could see. Within clear view of the restaurant the waiter and chef poked the pizza, closed the box and brought it out into the restaurant and handed it to another customer who must have been waiting for this order.This pizza was out of the shop for at least 15 minutes, and in my possession - how could they just poke it and give it to somebody else? This is a shocking level of service and shows what very poor opinion they have of their customers and how little pride they have in their food.I took my pizza home to eat - hey, it wasn't my pizza that was taken away by a stranger and poked by possibly 5 hands. Unfortunately the pizza was rank. The cheese was dry and hard. It seemed to be cheap cheddar and not the mozzarella and parmesan as advertised. Furthermore, it seemed like old cheddar. Like the cheddar had been grated the day before and left to dry overnight. Perhaps it was the case that our 6pm pizza using yesterdays produce and you may or may not get more lucky if you eat later.Overall it was a disaster and not what I would expect from a family run Italian restaurant. No pride, no quality, no care for the customer. A shocker of an Italian. I can only hope that other bloke enjoyed his pokey pizza more than I resented mine."
Had the Sunday brunch yesterday and was delighted by the whole experience. The quality of the food and the service were top notch. Very friendly and helpful staff. The atmosphere with jazz/blues music was very relaxing. I can recommend the Ox cheek pie. Special mention for Laetitia who was very attentive.A great experience!
"Union Jacks was a must-go for us when we saw it at Covent Garden. In fact, we made it a point to go there for lunch.We were lucky enough not to have to wait too much and were seated in quite a short time, given there were a lot of people waiting.Once inside, we sat down on particular seats that had warmers fitted: quite a pleasant surprise after walking for quite some time in the cold weather. Apart from that, the food is fantastic: I ordered the traditional Fish&Chips, which were really tasty. My wife ordered the pork belly, which was equally delicious. The atmosphere of busy Covent Garden does not decrease the relaxed one inside. One can view people strolling by or even street performers just by the restaurant. This made our stay there even more amusing."
"I booked a table before we went to see the ballet for 5.15. I was pleased to see we had a booth seat perfect for the room as we had bags, coats and children in tow. Plenty of space for 4 of us. The service was good attentive, polite and not overbearing. The food was nice. Just the right size. We also found the price very reasonable for London. This was a good find, close to the theatre and attractions. I felt relaxed and happy being in a restaurant where I was not rushed, cramped or dissatisfied with the establishment. I would definitely recommend if you want a nice little restaurant that serves food at a reasonable price with a lovely atmosphere."
"Sandwich bars in London have improved greatly in recent years, and Pret is one of the reasons for it. By trial and error you can find other, more interesting places for lunch on the run, but Pret is always there."
"I hadn't heard of this place but friends ordered in and I was genuinely surprised by the quality of the food. The batter was crisp and free of grease, the fish tasted good, the chips were the right size, and the mushy peas the way they should be."
"Lovely little cocktail bar , fantastic atmosphere , fantastic staff and service , just off Covent Garden by the street entertainers , which are great fun , great shopping too x"
"Received rudeness, terrible service & dishonesty here today. The waitress was repeatedly rude and inattentive. On top of that, we were also charged for something that the person who ordered did not receive (because it was mistakenly served to someone else at the table & the waitress insisted he had ordered it), and then was not brought the second time it was ordered. And despite the fact that I told her this after the main course had been eaten, this item still appeared on the bill as ""x2"" at the end, after we had gone through dessert. I went to the cashier and explained about the item as well as why I did not feel we could pay the service, and he still insisted because ONE had been consumed (though it was not by the person who had ordered it), we had to pay for it. I still refused, after which he agreed to take money off and hurried us through paying. We assumed it was because they were closing, but on coming home ive calculated that he had still charged us for one! Based on all of this, I have to take back my good impressions of the place based on previous visits and will let others know not to go there, and I have also changed my mind about organising a meal there for people from my company. Over the price of a side dish which was £2. To put things in perspective, this is only the second time ive ever had to refuse to pay service."
"Small portions and a limited menu make this a place of last resort to dine while in London. If the weather is horrible, it should work fine though if you can brave the outdoors, try somewhere else. Prices are high and the best part was the wine, thankfully prepared elsewhere."
We loved Pret a Manger. The sandwiches are great and the porridge is the best we've ever had. I wish we had Pret a Manger in Vancouver
"My comment is based on a single lunch experience in March. First time here for lunch with a colleague, with no reservation we sat by the bar facing the open kitchen. Decor of the restaurant is modern and comfortable. Both of us had attention caught by the daily special - steak + lobster + prosecco for GBP15++, which is a bargain comparing to other deals in the menu, or any restaurant of similar type nearby. I wasn't expecting much or thought size of the dish would be compromised but everything turned out to be fine. Guess the steak was about 4oz - perfectly cooked. 1/2 lobster - small but good. Fries and some green on the side and all on a chopping board. Our waiter specially put a napkin under the board in case of food juice leakage. During the meal we watched multi-national chefs busying in the kitchen and they were all swift and professional."
The restaurant is essentially an outdoor dining venue but it is within one of the market halls of Covent Garden Market. There is plenty of overhead and under-seat heating to keep guests comfortably warm. The menu is predominantly pizzas and salads.Service was efficient and the food arrive surprisingly quickly. The prices were quite reasonable for tourist location in the city centre.
"A conference I was attending in early December booked this floating restaurant for dinner on behalf of its presenters and guests. The view from the vessel, which is near the Embankment tube stop, is marvelous--the London Eye, etc. Beyond that, the experience was average.As my headline suggests, the boat was a bit rocky during our meal, which made some guests dizzy and a bit nauseous. Not much the crew can do to prevent this, but be forewarned that you won't get the same stability as you do on board a cruise ship. That should go without saying, but it bears repeating.Food itself was OK but scanty. Our group had a fixed menu with only two choices of each dish. The asparagus soup was light and tasty, not overly creamy. A winner. The bone-in chicken was OK but the portion was very small.The real story of the evening was the other ""main"" course, which turned out to be three pieces of cheese ravioli that even a light eater could inhale in one bite. The women at our table who ordered that dish had to wait a long time--and when their food finally came out, it wasn't how they had ordered it. In addition, they had to request vegetables to accompany the dish several times, and when at last the veggies reached the table they were cold.Nice ambience on board, but the service and food quality need to step up their game."
"Covent Garden has a plethora of choices for food, but sometimes choice can be a problem and we ended up walking round in circles not knowing where to go on a Saturday afternoon. With that in mind, we ended up plumping for a chain because it took the hassle out of everything. It turned out to be a good choice as this is one of the best TGIs ive been to. Good service, good food and reasonably priced. No, it isn't haute cuisine but it was fast food served fresh, perfect."
Evening meal from set choice the waiter was very confused brought us red wine when asked for white . Mixed up our starters order with another tables . Forgot our sides when bringing out mains the good was lovely when finally ate very over priced though. Hanger steak was tiny chips in bucket contained 5 chips ! Little disappointed to be honest
"Just an amazing array of deliciously rico Mexican food here... The Death Sauce burrito, to die for. The fish tacos, to drown for... If you like good Mexican, non-chain food and experience, go visit! #mexicanfood #killertomato #shepherdsbush"
"Came here for a celebration meal with some friends on a Tuesday evening as its close to where we all work. The good:Really varied menu at reasonable prices (a 1 1/2 pound lobster with chips and salad is £24.90- exceptionally reasonable for central London) Good location Nice decorFriendly staff The bad:A lot of things on the menu weren't actually available when we ordered, including house wine and basic dessertsOnly half the tables drinks Arrived before the food did - we were left chasing the other halfWe weren't given steak forks until after we had received our food We had to chase one of our desserts (just a bowl of ice cream!) and it came after everyone else had finished theirsVery slow service - a couple came in and then left after 10 minutes as after being seated no one had approached them. We were met with quite angry stares when we said we didn't want to pay their service charge.Huge shame as the food is very good and could riveal the chain Burger and Lobster. The staff were also very friendly (excluding the angry looking manager). Would maybe come again but would be wary of the wait times."
"Great location, affordable prices with a great atmosphere, I highly recommend to visit if you are a tourist in the city and want to experience a true traditional bar. The drinks and prompt service are really good, will definitely come back again if in London and in Marylebone."
"Pretty weak in my opinion. The place sells itself as having won a ""best restaurant in pimlico"" award. I would suggest that this is a pretty low hurdle rate.Having lived around the corner for a number of years, my experience is that pimlico Is desperately in need of restaurants akin to elsewhere in london, but doesn't get them because of the very low permanent occupancy rates (hence the really weird, constantly closed shops) and the fairly old, red trouser demographic (who seem to be riveted by such novel concepts as ""pizza"").Within this, Goya comparesmodestly favourably... If you enjoy reluctant, slow service, rubbery tortilla and mayonnaise (sneakily passed off as Ali oli).Seriously, eating here won't kill you. And it probably is within the top 3 restaurants in pimlico, but if you want proper tapas I'd highly recommend leaving this culinary wasteland and going to one of the many,Dramatically superior tapas places in london (Jose in borough, opera tavern in Covent Garden, brindisa in London BridgeOr south Ken, don felipes in Waterloo to name but a few) or if you're in the area, indulging in a 5 minute walk to either the Orange, Hunan or Tinello.Honestly, I'm surprised places like this still exist in London."
We had a late reservation at this popular restaurant and the only place available was at the bar. Service was excellent and the sashimi and octopus starters perfectly prepared. My guest's Thai Sea Bass was outstanding and my fish & chips good. The Chablis was on the expensive side but worth it. A superb restaurant with a great vibe! Tip - try and make a reservation well in advance.
"If you want real food, fast then Pret is your answer. It succeeds because they focus on quality fresh ingredients.P.S their cheese and tomato croissant is my naughty weekly treat, sshhhh!"
"My wife and I went for a brunch meal around 11am and even though it was busy, we were able to have 2 of the fab coffee's each and a stunning meal. My wife had the pancake's and I had the bacon burger with egg etc.The staff were just able to keep up and even when a child smashed a glass,the situation was delt with very quickly with no fuss made.The people next to us had the english breakfast and it looked top class.I will go back one day."
Love this place it has incredible Italian food that you can bring to your home and fresh pasta that you can buy and prepare in minutes at home. Good coffee and patisserie. This is as well a typical Italian shop. My only critics is that quite frequently is close at commercial hours (for London standard in Soho)and that is quite expensive compared with other delis. However is an historical part of Soho and of the Italian community in this city (the old guard). We have a great selection of food to bring home. Definitely love the place
"I went with some friends (corean and japanese) because I don't know what I can order. It is very fashionable and confortable (5 minutes by walk from Holborn station) and Always full of people.Better to book otherwise it is necessary waiting for 10/20 minutes at least.We ate Dolsot Bibimbap (like a paella...) and Yang Yeum Chiken and Dwen Jang Jjigae. I appreciated all things and I will go again. Prices are honest, good value."
"For the London traveler with no time for fancy sit-down lunches or trying to save some pounds (money-wise and body-wise!), this is a wonderful chain that offers a wide selection of sandwiches, wraps, soups, and other snacks that are all healthy. There are options for vegetarians and non-veg. In addition there is a large selection of coffee and non-coffee drinks, hot and cold. Highly recommended! There is also one somewhere in Heathrow Airport that offers a good in-between flight snack."
"We tired the fish stew and loved it so much that we decided to return the next day, but it was no longer available. Pity. We gave the steaks a try and really enjoyed the rib-eye. Puddings were lovely too, but could have added a non-chocolate option! Staff were friendly and attentive. Lovely addition to Blackheath Village,"
"Havent been to The Sea Shell for a few years but it still doesnt disappoint. Great service in the restaurant and top quality food. Cod and chips was fresh and delicious, cooked perfectly. Top job."
"Went for late lunch - so was pretty quiet but we still had to chase the waiter. Took a chinese friend but she was too polite to comment. Music was loud and like it was from the depth of a garage.And the food.....just plain awful - one of the dishes was salad with salmon. The fish was burnt in places, dry and crispy.The waiter cleared away our starter plates and bought out crispy duck and pancakes etc but no plates and he was surprised when asked for themJust an unpleasant experience"
"While the steaks are worthy of all their praise, this review is about their Sunday Lunch.I came here with friends a few months ago and enjoyed a near perfect Sunday lunch.We skipped starters and went straight for the Roast Beef main.The beef was a thick slab of medium rare perfection that was juicy and tasty. There were roast garlic that was amazing but the highlight was the Bone Marrow sauce.We ordered a few bottles of Malbec to get us through the meal and they worked a treat.While not a cheap day out it was a great meal and we're definitely coming back."
"Simple menu, excellent hamburger, great beer...and very friendly staff!We had a very nice time and in fact came back to this restaurant for an encore because their burger was so juicy, tender, and succulent. We think it was the fried egg atop each of their sandwiches that make makes them so delicious. The only glitch was a mix up in the order, but we liked the mistaken order just the same! The restaurant is small andit is often reserved out. While it is disappointing to see empty tables with a reserved tag on them, it is good to remember thatthat the UK they take restaurant reservations seriously. Best to have your hotel make your reservations, that sometimes helps. This, we feel, is the best deal near Hyde Park corner."
"Always great be it pizza, pasta or the ribs. Go a couple of times a month. Friendly staff and decent value."
"ive eaten here a few times for business lunches and once in the evening and found the food and service largely faultless. But the thing about Trip Advisor is that when an establishment like this lets itself down, there's now a wider forum in which to publicise the problem. The humourless, older guy with what appeared to be a French accent serving at the Whiskey Bar on Friday afternoon was really out of line. He told us when we attempted to settle at the bar for the afternoon and our first drink wasn't alcohol that ""didn't we know this is a whiskey bar and if you don't want to drink there are plenty of coffee places around Victoria station"". We said something on the way out -- to another bar."
"The quality of food and choice of menu is excellent. Party of 5, all the dishes were perfect. There is only one issue that in my opinion marks this restaurant down i.e. the fact that we were packed in like sardines on the ground floor level. Apparently they have another level which we will try next time."
"A prime location in the heart of tourist land so we expected to wait for a table. We were told by a rather unfriendly staff member that it would be at least an hour. We decided to wait at the bar and people watch. It became obvious to us that the long waiting time was due to a lack of staff to turn around the tables. Our wait was about 40 minutes which wasn't too bad. Our waiter was friendly and informative. Our food was nice as were the cocktails. We spent just under £100 for 2 courses with drinks for 4 people, not bad for what we had and where it is located."
"This pub was lovely, overlooking Borough Market. Little more expensive then I would like, but the food was really good, the beer was cold, and it had all of the traditional ambience I was looking for in a pub for lunch. I don't know if I would go completely out of my way for it, but if you're in the area, it's a nice place to sit down for lunch."
"I recently dined here on Valentine's night. At booking, I had requested a window table. However, on arriveal we were shown to a table in the middle of the boat right next a speaker, which made conversation difficult. Luckily, we were then moved to a very nice window table. The setting was magical and the views on the Thames were excellent. There was a live singer, which created a nice atmosphere.The Valentine's set menu had a good selection to choose from. My starter of scallops was a bit disappointing; however, I enjoyed my steak main course and caramel mousse dessert.The staff were polite and friendly, however, some servers appeared somewhat inexperienced, and I was aware of a few order mix-ups at other tables. Overall, this was a most enjoyable occasion, and was a nice treat for Valentines."
"Had my leaving drinks here, excellent staff. Got loads of character . Quaint and rustic and i always enjoy coming here."
We went to London for the day and picked Elliots as it looked interesting from their web site. We picked our meal from a very interesting menu and had a nice bottle of wine to go with it. The bread we were served as we sat down was warm and possibly the best ive ever had. We both really enjoyed the meal which was full of flavour and some interesting ingredients and the staff were very friendly and attentive. It wasn't a cheap meal but we thoroughly enjoyed it. Would definitely go back.
"Nice vibe in a non pretentious atmosphere, friendly staff and good honest food.It is worth stopping by and it is a really nice restaurant in the middle of busy Covent Garden. Prices are reasonable. All in all a nice find and a place we will go back to."
"My favourite Lebanese. Fab pastries, skewers, meatballs with rice and Baklava to die for. Keep going back for more."
Wow what a place. It is right in the heart of Covent Garden. The food is terribly british and absolutely delicious. I was so spoilt for choice. I had a lamb steak. It was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. My friend shared a pizza with her daughter (my god daughter) and they had the coleslaw as a side. The coleslaw was that nice I finished it off with my steak. Oh and to top it all James mars den (hollywood actor) was dining there. My god daughter recognised him and he was lovely with her. It really was the icing on the cake
"The place itself is lovely, however the food was ridiculous for the money. One scallop for £10. ONE! And 3 prawns for £15. Each dish came out separately so we didn't have anything at the same time. It just isn't worth the money. Food was Ok but not anything special, certainly not worth what they charge."
"I visited last week with my friend while we were in London for a few days.We Arrived at around 8.15pm and it was very full, the staff managed to find us a table within around 5 minutes.The food was really nice and there wasn't too much waiting around.Nice quality meal and good service."
"As with all TGI's, this was no exception. Quick service, good cocktails and ok food. Nothing special, just 'OK'."
"My cousin recently moved in to a flat in the area and we decided to try this place out. We were really glad we did! There's a great atmosphere and so many interesting touches. Very unique!! From the food to the cocktails to the service, everything was spot on. This place is definitely a must to try!"
"We were staying around the corner for a conference and Rosa's was convenient, fast, delicious and at a good price. They also offered take-away so some days we would just grab food and get back to work. The staff is super friendly and give great advice if you don't know what to order and have amazing ginger tea which was just the thing during the heatwave. They also helped modify some of the dishes to accommodate my gluten allergy which was very nice of them. I reccommend the spring rolls, fresh rolls, the pineapple fried rice,pad thai and my favorite was the chilli & basil stir fried flat noodles (guay tiew pad kee mao) with beef."
"Stopped here for a panini which was pretty basic to say the least was toasted but only just I had tuna and cheese and peppers hardly any cheese on the panini and had only small amount of red pepper my husband was supposed to have gammon, Ham and cheese he had very little cheese and only wafer thin ham so much to disappointment really"
Very good food and waiter Monica (Polland)Good place ! Good people and stores !Best place in London Thank so much Espero voltar sempre pois Londres e terra de hospitalidade progresso e gente preparada
"I visited Proud East to celebrate a friends birthday with pool, ping pong and some food and we were not disappointing! It's such a lovely walk along the canal to the place. The venue itself has a lovely vibe, relaxed but still fun and the food was great, we started with some sharing platters (the ribs on the meat platter were amazing!) and ended up ordering mains too as it was so good! I ordered a steak sandwich which I loved and the burgers looked great too.We were so well looked after by the team in the venue too, everyone was friendly and wanted to check we were enjoying ourselves, as such we have already booked again for Christmas lunch!"
Very tasty food. Friendly personal. I liked it. Was there with my mother and sister. Was very hungry after long day traveling through London. And ours place of relax was amazing. For sure recomend it.
"We visit London a number of times a year. The first time we time we visited the Tgi's at Covent Garden, we had a fantastic time. The atmosphere was brilliant, the staff we welcoming & they gave my husband advice on what cut of steak to have. We were served quickly even though the restaurant was extremely busy. The food was delicious. We have been back to this restaurant a few times now and the service and food are second to none!!! Will continue to go back."
"We visited here about 1.30 on a Saturday. It ws very popular, but we were still able to get seats. Service was quick and friendly. The roti chani was drier amd heavier than what I'd had in Malaysia, but ilthe flavour was there and the dhal was nice. The Nasi Lemak was too spicy but reminded me on the original. Makan also sells English breakfast. However, it is the most authentic Malaysian food outside of Malaysia ive had."
"This is a very charming Italian restaurant in a nice location. We were fortunate to find their seppia on the specials list, but everything was great. Very friendly staff. We will certainly return on our next visit to London."
I am not a big fan of British pub food but Green Pea is absolutely great. I really can't imagine the pies and boiled ham being any better that the stuff that Tom serves. If you are ever in Greenwich you have to visit it.
"Just popped in one lunch time with my family and sat at the bar. We all had a great lunch with a variety if dishes, all well cooked and the staff were friendly and efficient. It was good value for the quality."
"Me and a few friends were looking for an outside spot to have a drink on a warm Saturday evening around 9pm. Having had a somewhat disappointing experience at the other couple of places we had been that evening, what a joy it was to happen upon this place.We sat at a tabla outside and inquired as to whether we ordered inside at the bar or not, we were told somebody would come out to us.A very smartly dressed waiter came promptly with drinks menus and asked if we were eating, we were not!He was so lovely and welcoming and went through the drinks with us, when he came to deliver our order to the table, he did so with flair and took the time to have a friendly chat with us...What a difference great service like this made to our evening.George was wonderful. Will definitely return if again in the area.Thank you!Katue"
We had a priveate function on Xmas day lunch. The food was outstanding along with the service. Will defo visit again. Thank you for the hospitality.
"Having wanted to eat in polpo for as long as I can remember, I was excited to go last night (Friday). Really disappointed. Firstly the front of house guy was rude. So rude that the waitress apologised on his behalf. Food was just warm in temperature and not as flavoursome as I had imagined it to be. Plus the wines served in tumblers. Probably will not be returning ."
I don't often give a bad review but I was really disappointed after waiting at the counter and the lady ignored me only then to let me know the kitchen was closed early. Way before 10:30
I have not ever had a bad meal at any of their restaurants. It is one of the few that has a menu that is clear for people like me who have intolerances
"Bought this on an Experience Day voucher to celebrate my husbands 60th Birthday. What a waste of money. It was a rainy night, the table we sat at was under a leak and the table was wet through, so firstly we had to ask to be moved.The meal was a 3 course. First course was soup which was luke warm, no bread rolls offered.Second course pork, plenty of pork but very little else, just a few cubes of vegetables hidden under the meat.Third course was ok.But halfway through the meal a small visitor appeared running round the floor!!!! (will leave this to your imagination) We were offered firstly a free drink, when I said this was a special occassion and a drink did not compensate, we were offerred a refund of 50% of price paid, but we were then told because we had already pre paid on an experience day voucher they could not refund, so could they could only offer us free drinks.Needless to say we got out as fast as we could, and would never go back."
"Food is great, there are vegetarian options and you do feel you came to an authentic place. Even though it is not a restaurant but a deli, service is great. Price wise you can't have cheaper. Overall an Italian pearl in the heart of Fulham. The right place to bring someone special for a drink and some mouthwatering food."
"this restaurant serves delicious food and the atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. the service is great, wine choice excellent. There is nothing to dislike about this brilliant restaurant"
"I was intrigued by this place after hearing good reviews. We ordered the Chicken Satay, Shrimp Pad Thai and Duck Tamarind although everything on the menu looked great. The decor and atmosphere is nothing to write home about but I would recommend to anybody for the quality of the food and the good value. The effort that had gone into presentation of the dishes was also an appreciated touch."
"A couple of us visited this place during a business trip. Friendly staff, plenty of tables and the best steak I have had for a while. Served with their frites, and their own special sauce. Two helpings all round. The salad starter was a hit too."
I decided to come back to visit Tom. This time with some friends to let them try the delicious pies that they make here. We call first by phone to make sure that they would be ready for our visit. I think is better to call them to make sure they have food and they can serve you otherwise you will be disappointed. They don't want that so. Thanks again for a delicious pie. My friend were really happy and I had a small nap in the sofa alter eating. Feeling like at home. ++++++++++++100%100%+++++++++++
"Food was good, cocktails were good....the only thing that ruined our visit was the very slow service. We had theatre tickets, so by the time our food Arrived, we had to rush in order to make it to the theatre on time :( shame really, because the food had potential to bee really lovely, but trying to scarf down a massive burger in 15 minutes kind of diminishes the experience."
"Visited Elliot's for lunch on a busy Thursday. Booking is essential, we overheard there was a half a hour wait for some impromptu visiters. The food is of the highest quality and cooked perfectly. Can highly recommend the onglet which was tasty, tender and delicious. I had the asparagus with brown bread and egg to start. This was a mixture of croutons and chopped hard boiled egg on the asparagus and was excellent. Couldn't manage a third course but was very intrigued by the bacon, bourbon and prune ice cream! It's slightly more expensive that you would expect to pay for somewhere that calls itself a cafe but the whole meal, including the carafe of wine, was first class. Would also add the staff were friendly and helpful with sound suggestions."
"Good selection of Samuel Smiths draft and bottle Beers, with local Atmosphere, busy when the local work is finished"
"It's quite interesting to read other reviews for this restaurant and find good reviews. I notice they are mainly from overseas visitors so maybe they think this is the standard of our food here in the Uk??? !! Sad.I had the chicken and my husband had the sausage and mash. I'm afraid the only way I can describe it is as not very well cooked/presented pub grub!! We were very disappointed. The staff we very friendly and helpful and the service was quick and good. We couldn't fault the staff, the location or the atmosphere. But the food .......I'm sure, for the cost, we could have eaten much better somewhere else in Covent Garden.Sorry Jamie, you need to up your game!!"
"Yo Sushi is a chain and the food standards are pretty consistent - although one of the Sushi I ordered seemed to be a bit or a rush job, with the seaweed wrap half hanging off. Luckily it all tasted great, and the staff were nice. A good place to go on your own, as you can sit at the bar rather than at a table by yourself."
"We visited, with another couple, Elliot's cafe on Friday 30th August. The service was chaotic and two dishes did not appear. When I asked for the missing dishes I was told by the manager, Felix, very rudely ÏDon't get smart with me. This was insulting and put a real downer on the evening. Later on that evening, when I told him how rude I thought he had been, he was totally unrepentant and accused me of being drunk. This comment could not have been further from the truth. I will never go there again and for the first time ever, I refused to pay any service. Felix was a disgrace."
Stayed at the Copthorne within the Chelsea Village and ate at Marco's. The food is amazing even as simple as corn fed chicken with sweet potato fries. Good portions £14 maybe pricey but hey your in London.
"We were given the gift of a salmon carving masterclass by a friend. The whole experience from beginning to end was fantastic. We were greeted by Darren Matson (who holds the Guinness World Record for salmon carving) and immediately felt at ease. Darren is very friendly and knowledgeable and also has a great sense of humour! He took us on a tour of the building, including the event venue and roof terrace, explaining as we went the history of Forman's and his own part in the business. We then went onto the Ïfactory floor to begin our salmon carving, which started after Darren had demonstrated how to do it properly! Following our attempts at carving the salmon, Darren packaged it up for us to take home along with the board, knife and boning tweezers.This was, without doubt, one of the best experiences we have had due, in no small part, to Darren Matson's outgoing and friendly personality. We would highly recommend this experience."
"We went to thirty six for a family event for sunday brunch. I didn't know what to expect but was mostly pleasantly surprised. Let's talk about the food first. I didn't find it particularly impressive or outstanding. You start with a buffet type breakfast with cold meats, bread, fruit, nothing special but enough to keep most people interested. You can then order a main which is then prepared in the kitchen. What stood out was the service and the ambience. The manager and the staff was just absolutely excellent. They were friendly without being patronising, attentive without being overbearing and made us feel at home. I don't say this lightly but this was probably the best service I ever received. Also the restaurant projects a warm, friendly atmosphere. Not particularly busy, it's decorated in a traditional style with a modern flavour. Its cosy and welcoming and was perfect for a cold winters day. I will recommend just based on the service!"
"Visited with a friend last night and had such a lovely night.My friend was indecisive about which beer to have due to the wide range and variety which is good, so the manager behind the bar gave him some tasters and recommendations. Very kind. Food was amazing! Grilled Halloumi and terrine to start were very tasty, and the steak we both had for main was even better! They were both cooked to perfection and were delicious. To top it off it was quiz night in the bar! Very nice atmosphere with great attentive staff. Our server Ludavica was helpful and so smiley. Definitely a good vibe between staff and customers, loved the friendliness. Home away from home place. Thank you for the perfectly chilled but fun Monday evening Roundhouse!"
"It's next to the railway station and just off the M 25. Four of us met from Central London, Hemel Hempstead, Saffron Walden and Bedford - just about all four points of the compass. Two hours allowed on the parking meters. Ideal location for lunch and always a friendly reception. Traditional Italian dishes freshly prepared. We'll do it again."
"Delicious food and great service from such lovely smiley staff. Definitely lived up to expectations..Will definitely return again, and again!"
"Found this place by accident. Initially wanted to catch a musical show but all shows were sold out. Glad to have find the restaurant. Had mussels, soup and fish and chips. The kitchen is very slow with the fish and chips though. Waited for almost 20mins after the serving of my soup and mussel. I actually commented to the waited that ""at last you have fished the fish""... Not acceptable given its Jamie Oliver association. Otherwise, the food are quite good."
These are the thing I liked about this restaurant:Nice atmospehreLovely locationGreat food and very generous portionsLive musicVery romantic
"Was in the Westminster Abbey area, Cold and chanced upon this Pret A Manger where I ordered a Mushroom Risotto. Really enjoyed it. One can easily find Pret A Manger at various locations in London for a quick meal."
"We dined at 2850 last night, the cooking was faultless, dish conception intelligent, execution precise, balance and seasoning perfect, service was impeccable with wine suggestions that were a match made in heaven! An amazing meal!"
"I loved! excellent place if you have kids, but if not it is still very cool cafe with great coffee and food"
"Hidden away down an alley just down the road from Kings Cross (opposite the Scala) but worth seeking out for a reasonable tapas. Prices not too bad for the area. We had a full selection of dishes and nothing I wouldnt have again, although the chorizo was perhaps the least favourite (not as spicy as I like). We were a bit rushed near closing time, but could take our drinks outside under a heated umbrella for a while. But, even then , we were ushered out not long after midnight."
"I was dissapointed to be barely greeted on entering despite being dripping wet and offered nowhere to put an equally dripping umbrella, a vague wave in the direction of the cloakroom, which I eventually found, along with a freindly and helpful smile, so things began to look up. We were looked after well in the dining room with very welcome advice on lunch selection and accompanying wines. The only blip was a cocktail that I was really looking forward to trying, I might have suspected something was amiss as a quarter of an hour later our waiter is back empty handed, one of the key ingredients was not to be found in any of the bars in the entire club, ho hum, no problem. We happily got on with lunch and our conversation both of which was very good. Did I say no problem, well it was a good job I checked the bill, (which I often don't when someone else in this case a member was paying it), there was the non-existant cocktail! Overall I did enjoy my visit, as it is a lovely cosy club to be in, it's just a pity that the attention to detail was missing, which could be easily forgiven on a very busy pressurised day, this didn't appear to be one of them to me."
This was a Christmas present for my husband and I. It was such a treat and the food was amazing.All the staff were very attentive and especially the Italian waiters who were happy for me to practice my rusty Italian on them.
"We had the groupon/amazon local deal for the 10oz steak. The meat was definitely not fresh at all and they'd tried to hide it through salting it heavily. All you could taste was salt!! We even got food poisoned. Right after paying off the bill, we all were in immediate need of washrooms. I would have thought that might have been due to something else if it happened to only one of us. But funny thing was that all of us were sick! The service was OK, though I see no point in that if the first requirement in a good restaurant is the food quality."
"My first time along with my wife. Friends special birthday. I could not fault the service or the food it was just great, surroundings also very good choice good, and for all the wine drinkers again great selection. Nothing I could list that would be worng."
"I bought a meal here from a discount site - and sometimes these can be a bit risky if someone is trying to rescue a failing enterprise. This was not the case here - the staff were brilliant - the cocktails were good and the food was excellent. We thoroughly enjoyed the night. the next evening we were going to a 2 Michelin starred restaurant and we knew that however good it was that the Park Terrace had effectively ruined it for us by being so great - with 2 bottles of wine and 1 bottle of Prosseco, including 3 cocktails - this meal (4 courses for 3 people) cost me in total about £180 - the night after I paid £700 for something similar - there was nowhere near £520 difference. Give it a go."
"In an area packed with great food and things to sample and see, Elliot's is a discrete standout. We Boris biked here on a rare crystal clear day and were ready for a really good meal and got one and more. The setting is a small warm and light wooded charming liveing room style atmosphere, short on the pretension with a nice skylight in back and a bar up front - nothing fancy but perfect for an organic oriented menu with a strong selection of fish and meat dishes and interesting starters (crab on toast for example) as well as interesting vegetarian fare cooked in interesting and delicious ways (yes including kale) and some unique deserts including chocolate fondants one of which could have sunk a battleship. The wine menu is largely or mostly organic and Charlie, the opera singing manager of the day we were there spent a great deal of time taking us through a variety of reds and whites from Australia to Serbia until we found the one that hit the spot (Astina from Serbia - a very interesting white and also try the 'A Forest'"" from Australia. Lena who served the table was also in a great mood and came out of the restaurant to get us to the destination when Google maps failed (as usual), It's a great place to spend an afternoon and pretty rare - great atmosphere, people, no rush, and overall ambience. I would put this in the top 10 of overall dining experiences and great for a long lazy lunch which is what we had."
"I had dinner with my cousin here last week. As usual, we were met at the entrance by very friendly staff. Our drinks and food Arrived in good time. The portions were excellent value for money and the loos were clean.My only reservation is sharing the tables, however, the tables are large and so you still have your own space."
"Booked our table on line ..We Arrived earlier than we were booked for ,Luckily our table was available.. We skipped the starters and went on to order 4 steaks..Cooked to perfection ,Makes my mouth water thinking about them..After our main meal we were all still hungry so we opted for dessert,which again was very tasty..Overall the meal was very good but portions small and slightly overpriced..service was very good too.but it was not overly busy !"
"We had booked this table well in advance - I was introducing my family and friends to a restaurant I was already familiar with and they were not disappointed, what a welcome. That along with the cocktails, the food and the service was the best. My 19 year old niece commented on that she had never seen or had service like this before. We were a bit cheeky in taking a birthday cake along and this was ""no bother"" to the restaurant - we did offer them a bit of cake. Philip was on duty which was also a bonus, as always. Loved the night, loved the new decor we all want to come back soon Philip. Lovely to see Miriam there as well. Big slainte to you all, best night xxx"
"Lovely friendly staff and good atmosphere, but the food really wasn't good. I definitely could have made something better myself. I ordered sausage and broccoli pasta which was completely tasteless - it needed about 10 times more salt. My boyfriend ordered a sausage with tomato sauce oven dish which was ok-ish. We shared a tomato and onion salad which had wayyyy too much onion. A shame because everything was great until we got the food. Maybe the pizza is better? I'm yet to try."
we decided to try this place out this week and found that you could get half a lobster for less than £10 on the special lunch menu.the service was good and absolutely no complaints about the foodi would go back
"Two of us ordered the same starters and main course from the pre theatre menu. The soup was fantastic, lovely colour and texture with a poached egg hidden within. Neither of us have eaten pollock before and we were pleasantly surprised. It's a white meaty fish and it was as fresh as can be.Lovely informative table attendants. We shall return. An ideal position for a wander round Covent Garden and for theatre land."
"Stopped off in Covent Garden after a trip to see Mr Sinatra at The Palladium. The atmosphere in Union Jacks was fantastic, as you're sitting out in the middle of the covered area of Covent Garden. You have all the noise and hustle & bustle of this fantastic part of London. There was an African festiveal one side of us and a street entertainer the other side. Probably not the place to go if you want to quietly unwind. The service was fantastic, we were looked after really well. Food was great, a little pricey but you are slap bang in the middle of Covent Garden, what do you expect!! I'd definitely go back next time I'm that way."
"This pub has now become is a nice place to have Sunday lunch not your usual pub price dinners and alcohol is pricey but good , no longer your common or garden boozer but still nice for quiet drink."
My boyfriend and I visited Rasoi for a mid week dinner. Set in a backstreet off Sloane Square it is quite a surprise to find an Indian restaurant here. Inside the decor was delightful and totally appropriate for an Indian restaurant of this quality. On seeing the tasting menu we opted for that despite the price. We were not disappointed with the quality of food and the efficient service. The tandoori salmon and foie gras were both favourites of mine. Sadly the restaurant didn't have the matched wines for the tasting menu but the sommelier was able to provide some great advice on what we could have that would work. His knowledge of the wines was impressive and what I would expect in a restaurant of this standard. All in all a lovely dinner.
One of the top five Wetherspoon - a gem. A great job has been on turning the head office of HSBC into a pub. This is a large pub with lots of wood panelling. Good service with friendly staff. Excellent value for the City of London
"We never actually made it in, we were waiting in line to be seated by the sign that asked us to do so, to the right if the door. An extremely rude waitress with a severe attitude problem came and asked us if were waiting to be seated and then told us to do so properly behind the sign so other people could get out, she then moved the sign to a place more likely to make it impossible to get in or out (in the middle of the entrance) and completely overlooked the fact that another door which could have been used as a serviceable exit, had been closed by staff! We asked her how long we could expect to wait (there were loads of empty tables) she held her ""stop sign"" hand in our faces and said ""just a minute!"". She then went off and never came back so we decided to they could stick it and went to somewhere far nicer with non-rude, human staff. Would never bother again, disgusting treatment and utterly vile waitress! I would sooner rummage for lunch in a dust bin than waste my money here, hope the rude woman gets fired!"
"A great night out for the family. We are all fans of sea food in our family and mussels come high on our list of favourites. The buzz and atmosphere of Belgo restaurants is intoxicating.We shared a few starter dishes of wings, meats, bread and pate'. Great fun picking and nibbling whilst chatting and catching up. A pint of one of the beers on offer definitily helped.The moule dishes were excellent. We each have our own favourite but happily swap and sample each others. Not enough frites though, don't be stingy Belgo.The service was intially brilliant, however, I think the madness of the evening got to our waiter. He looked lost and bewildered at times as the pressure of the evening got to him. My view. He was still courteous but lost his sparkle after dealing with a couple of larger parties. Perhaps more staff would help ;o)Still, a brilliant night and we will be visiting a Belgo very soon."
Food and service was good but be aware that you should read the small print as against relying upon the reception staff telling you that a 15% discount would be given upon the Christmas meal yet found an excuse for not giveing it and not agreeing to putting it right after the event. Don't like that.Also be aware that if the tide is out it is like climbing up and down the Eiger to get on and off the boat. Fair chance if in a wheel chair would end up in the Thames.
"Our waiter was charming and fun but the tea was a little disappointing. Previously had Alice in Wonderland tea which was brilliant, very well themed and great food. This one was ok but didn't blow you away. The savoury course nicer than the sweet although the flavoured candy floss was fabulous. Service was fine but not great. Worth a visit but wouldn't give it a wow."
"My husband and I use Cote in St Martin's Lane when we want a quick and tasty bite to eat at lunchtime but we have also used the restaurants in Blackheath and Bluewater where the food and service have been just as good. This is an excellent chain where the food - especially the daily specials - is very good. We like to treat ourselves to Michelin-starred restaurants occasionally, but when time (and money) is short, we always got for Cote."
Perfect location if youre a tourist and fancy some food drinks or on your lunch. Sunday lunch was just right and waitress was so welcomin and effecient. Everyone who came in she greeted as she was serving ..lovely. good venue to watch some sport too and a perfect place to chill
Went as part of a night out and would have missed it if not aware of where it was. Down some steep steps into what can best bring described as a minimalist cellar. Bare contests walks with random works of art on the wall. Very cosy and the music was OK but the cocktails were great and very good value for money. Tried a couple of apple pies and holy freuds all of which were very tasty and over powered by too much alcohol. Overall a great place to start a night out!
"Best pies in England! Nice desserts as well. With a very reasonable price. Highlight: the discussion with the owner, simply delightful!"
"£22 for a small salad box: guacamole,quinoa,even the beans seemed like were added to the salad by the piece,and few chicken cubes on top (hardly a whole breast of chicken) is way way too high and ridiculous no matter how good and healthy it was.Common!!!"
"A lovely family run restaurant with proper home made delicious Italian food. They even import their won oranges and tomatoes. The vongole is wonderful. You can bring your own booze and read the great collection of mags if you are on your own.Unpretentious, great prices and probably the best restaurant in W9"
"We had lunch in this Jamie Olivers typically British styled restaurant at Covent Garden. Our choice was fish (haddock) and chips accompanied by a nice IPA beer, produced by the famous British winery Chapel Down. A large selection of wines are available, also several offered by the glass. Price is higher than the average value you would expect in a pub but the quality is also superior."
"The staff are friendly but a bit clueless - our drinks came after our food, we had to ask for them a lot, some things were muddled up. The place is tiny and quite squashed. The food is fine - the bone marrow mashed potato is incredible. An american I was with was happy with the ribs."
"So, me and my friend was here to eat lunch. The food was so bad! The beef tasted like it was burned to death, and the frensh fries haven't even touched the salt. The service was bad aswell. We sat for about 15 minutes after we had asked for the check! And they even took £3 for ""service""! If you want bad food and bad service, go to this place‰ÏÎ•ü"
"The pub setting, menu and service is impeccable at The Calf, as I experienced today. Would definitely recommend and will 100% be going back. Lovely pub for all occasions in the heart of Clapham"
"After a hectic day of sightseeing in London we came across ""Little Frankies"" just off Trafalgar Square. It was busy, but staff were friendly and efficient and we were seated and served promptly. We had a lovely meal that was really great value for money. Certainly warmed us up on a cold, damp October evening before we returned to the airport.Such a shame that we left a souvenir photograph on our table and after e-mailing the restaurant to ask if it had been found and if they could forward it on.....we never heard from them again."
"We visited last November and had an enjoyable meal after a long day shopping. This time we were in no doubt where we would eat and they didn't disappoint. We were served by Floriana again, such a friendly and welcoming member of staff. The food was gorgeous and freshly made as usual, another perfect end to a London shopping trip."
"Unless run by a renowned chef, or, indeed, operating as a separate unit within, I generally avoid hotel restaurants. Somehow hotel food is, well, hotel food!Having supported a charity event, one of the auction offerings was dinner at the Park Terrace so we dined, last night.We were subjected to a refreshing surprise. Whilst the bar lounge area is unmistakably a 'hotel' setting, the bar service was outstanding. My husband had ""the best"" vodka martini he could remember. The barman had taken a masterclass and we watched as he prepared the cocktail with panache and, unlike James Bond, it was stirred, not shaken.From greeting to seating the staff were first rate. Our waiter was charming, attentive but not overbearing. The rest of the team, including management were polished and could not do enough.Bread was promptly brought to the table and was delicious. Tap water was cool and faintly flavoured with cucumber (I believe ?).The menu is quite excellent. Lots of choice with dishes that are crowd pleasers and at a cost of £29.50 for 2 courses or £37.50 for 3, the value is outstanding.We started with one smoked salmon souffle on remoulade and my husband the garlic risotto with truffled deep fried quails eggs. Both were delicious.Mains were a grilled T-bone halibut sat on Lyonnaise potatoes (simply perfect) with asparagus. The addition of deep fried cods cheek (albeit lovely) was probably unnecessary. My husband had the English lamb trio and adored every mouthful.Both courses were delicious.Wine list was easy but, for the best part, were wines we hardly new, some of which seem expensive but we settled for half a bottle of Chablis and half of Chateau La Tour, both of which really were well priced and were perfect.The decor is contemporary, the staff quite wonderful, utterly polished and the experience was beautifully unpretentious.I am re-educated in the quality of a first class hotel dining experience and will, without doubt, visit again."
Tried to book a table at the last minute on a Thursday night and was advised that all tables were taken but they would try to fit us in if we came along a bit later. On arriveal we were shown to a great table for 2 and enjoyed a great dinner. The service was good and very friendly and the food was also excellent. The staff could not have been more helpful. It is a gastro type pub with a lovely lively atmosphere and great food. You will not be disappointed if this is the type of place you enjoy.
"I visited here yesterday with a group of 12 friends. Initially two of us Arrived and said that we would be arriveing in dribs and drabs and ordering and eating as and when. The staff couldn't have been more helpful! Over the course of the afternoon our numbers swelled from 2-13 and the staff went out of their way to accommodate us and ensure we had a lovely afternoon, which we did. The food was good, not exceptional, but the setting and atmosphere were excellent. Our waiter Manuel deserves a special mention as absolutely nothing was too much trouble for him and we all know how noisy and giddy a large party of ladies can be! A great afternoon!"
"6.45pm, needing a quick bite before a gig at the Palladium my squeeze and I got an outside table at this very busy (chain) restaurant and made a fast order. Drinks came up promptly and the food followed after a reasonable interval. On a warm evening a great place to watch the world go by. Food was tasty and service good. Two drinks two mains, one side order + tip = £39. Seated in the theatre by 7.25pm. No complaints."
"Stumbled across Dom's Place whilst in the area. We were bowled away by the excellent food, the reasonable prices and the wonderful staff.We shared a mixed grill which includes chicken shish, lamb shish, adana, wings, rice hummus, bread and salad in enormous portions. Everything was delicious, very fresh and interesting. We also had some olives which were very good With two beers the whole thing came to £36 which was great considering the quality and portion sizes. Staff were also lovely.Would highly recommend."
"For about the fourth time we journeyed to the Park Terrace with a Travelzoo offer of 4 courses and a cocktail for £59. As usual, the welcome and service were exemplary and as we drank our selected cocktails in the bar, the evening had already got off to a good start.There is a wide choice of around 6-8 items in each of meal sections. Dishes such as sole with scallop mousse and a delicious lemon creamy sauce, and three cuts of lamb with as rich a sauce as I have tasted, all went down a treat. The desserts are like works of art and tasty. And then when you think you can face no more, an exciting small cheese board arrives.This is the best food I eat in London and at around £100 for two including three glasses of wine, coffee and service, it is great value as well. I was taken to another restuarant where the bill for 4 was £800 and the food nothing like as good.And to ake things even better, as I paid the bill I was presented with a voucher for 25% off the total bill for another visit."
"Good location, friendly staff, but service could be better, but they did apologise for service when dishes Arrived out of order.Pleasant interior too."
"Been going here for years, and will certainly be back for more. The cocktail menu is huge and is pretty affordable for Central London. Venue is a little small and a little loud, but all round great none the less. Apple Pie for the win!"
"Elliots has been around in Borough Market for only the last couple of months. We visited it when it had just opened and had been impressed by our reception - very friendly - as well as the food. The advice had been to try the starters tapas-like and go for one of the mains, which were deemed (and so it proved) sufficient for four hungry people. We tried the same approach on our last visit. The menu had changed completely, reinforcing the fact that the Cafe sources its ingredients from the market. In fact the only common dish between our two visits were oysters. There is something for everyone on the menu from a salad, to fish and meat. We particularly liked the quince sorbet with poached quinces and an apple version as a pudding.Service was extremely friendly and overall the experience very good.The wine list in relatively short and although we have so far only drunk a couple of the whites, we have not been disappointed. Prices are about average for the area - roughly £5-£7 for somewhat generous starter plates and mains at £12-£14. The daily specials tend to be slightly more.The Cafe sits next to the oyster bar on Stoney Street - opposite Brindisa (itself a good destination) and so far has not disappointed."
"Love this place; its Art Nouveau interior, the Tarantino stylizes music play list and the really interesting beer menu. Not your ordinary London pub. A must is to try out something from the pizza meny."
"Staff like robots. Coffee like dishwater. Good point , location.Table was extremely sticky. The server didnt both to find lut if we wanted more to drink"
"If you're passing by the Melt Room, you MUST go in for their Nutella and Mascarpone dessert melt. It has genuinely changed my life."
"The Good Ship Benefit is like a dream! The main deck is pink and art deco-style (can I move in??) with the most beautiful cocktails, and we ate upstairs at the Lashitude restaurant. I had the pork belly as my main and the Pimms jelly dessert and both were absolutely delicious. I had a go on the chicken and the steak which my friends ordered, and the Benefit sundae which were all amazing, too! You also have to try the fries, which are the best ive had in London! The vibe was super relaxed, the views were amazing and the music was great, too - old school Destiny's Child and TLC! There are lovely lounge chairs out on the decks too so I'll definitely be back in the warmer months for cocktails after work!"
"Vegetarian choice no bun falafel ""burger"" consisted of 5 minute balls and a chunk of salad £10.50 - really??Staff really good - not their fault but definitely company needs to review its description of menu - didn't pay for the ""burger"" but didn't eat it anyway - disappointed"
"The carniveore really enjoyed a great burger here. Only limited and not-very-tasty options for the vegetarian, but that's okay, what else can you expect from a burger joint. Incredibly friendly staff, nice decor, good vibe."
I ordered a classic and the service was quick.The place is unpretentious and clean. The sandwich was tasty on sourdough bread and was piping hot! Although the sandwich didn't blow my socks off - it was reasonale value for money.
"Went to eat at The Sea Shell a few days ago with my girlfriend, was in the area and stumbled across this restaurant, the restaurant was buzzing and I thought it wouldn't be possible to get a table however they were able to seat us straight away. Service was excellent, prompt and attentive without being intrusive and the food was delightful and well priced. Would recommend to anyone and shall return soon."
Really sweet thai restaurant. Lovely friendly atmosphere and obliging staff. Delicious food that is good value for money. Three dollar signs is incorrect
i had been first time food was delicious and servis so friendly mostly i like the presentation of the food thanks we will viveit you soon
"I dined at Goya about a month ago, and to be fair the service was okay, but the food was absolutely shocking. I had heard good things from a friend, so, as I was hungry I ordered quite a selection of the tapas on offer. The meatballs were unlike any meatballs ive ever tasted, horrendous, the squid like rubber. Vile. The wine which was 20 quid was the best thing the restaurant had going for it. As stated, I will not be returning."
"This is a large pub due to the addition of three small conservatories that provide light as well as good seating. The menu is interesting and provides something for everyone. The service is friendly and efficient and the food delicious. Over a hundred clocks are on display on the walls, fitting for the town synonymous with time."
We happened to be in Fulham buying some running shoes when hunger struck. We popped in to La Pizzica not expecting much and ended up having some of the best Italian food we have ever had. I had a massive lasagne and some meatloaf and the lady had 2 types of pasta. We both had double deserts. Extremely Italian. Everyone in there was from Italy and clearly had a passion for the food they were cooking. A little gem of a cafe which was perfect for a late lunch on a Saturday.
We had a nice late lunch here. The pizza was very good. Two of us had the Calzones. They were delicious.
"We ate here on a Sunday, 6.30ish so got a table without a reservation. We were put in a smaller area to the main restuarant where we were the only diners, although other diners came in towards the end of our meal. The restaurant decor is lovely and is it's candlelit was quite romantic, although would be different on a busy weekend evening I'm sure. We had the set dinner at £19.95, but on the menu we were presented with in the restaurant there didn't seem to be the same variety of dishes advertised on the menu outside or on their website. However, we've not had Morrocan before, so decided it was a good idea as would give us opportunity to try a bit of a few dishes. Lovely hummus and pitta to start. Vines leaves and pototoes with sausage. Main was cous cous, chicken, vegetables and spinach and lamb with prunes and almonds. The lamb was delish. Mint tea and baklava follow. Not had Morrocan mint tea before and now wondering where I can get some from.The food was really good and our waitress was excellent. Considering we were the only ones in the room for most of the meal and I think she was serving in the other room as well, she never left us waiting or hovered close by, but turned up to ask us if we would like any of the dishes refilled (free of charge if all parties have the set menu) and clearing away promptly. She explained what the dishes were and how they are traditionally eaten. The two set menus, a Morrocan red and a lemonade came to £66 with service. Was a lovely meal and would like to return with friends on a more lively night when they have belly dancing and see if the food and service are still as good."
"Our first time here and when we Arrived, they had not got our reservation on their system???It had been overlooked!!!This turned out OK because the place only had a few customers at 7pm on a Friday night!There is a lot of competition in the Marylebone area (we eat there a lot) so may be that is why it was not busy?This gave us a clue as what to expect.The atmosphere/ambience is OK, but a bit dark and the music a little loud.We have to say the food was very good and the staff are really great, our waiter was very attentive and courteous.We had starters which were creative and very good, the steak for mains was good as were the chips, the vegetable side dishes were really good. The service was a little slow but that did not worry us too much.We found the water at £5+ a bottle quite expensive and overall the prices are expensive for what you get especially the steak at £16.50 if you were not on a deal!!!.The last issue was over the bill at the end, we were on a voucher deal and there was a very confusing bill where the value of the voucher was reduced by the commission to the company we got the vouchers from, Groupon/Amazon.We use Amazon deals a lot and this is the first time we have had an issue like this!!!!The manager sorted it out but not before a very long discussion about the deal versus their own deal.This confusion somewhat spoilt the evening and the Reform need to get this sorted out otherwise they will not get people to return!!!"
"Just walking in the area looking for a place for lunch. My youngest daughter needs to eat gluten free, so not all places are ok. We checked and they had gluten free food. All was nice. Burger for my daughter was good and the gluten free break was great. For my 2 daughters nice to have lunch in a business area. My oldest (13) now knows that she like to study first. Overall a nice place for lunch. Prise wise ok. Bit on the high end put overall good."
What a lovely evening.. Great friendly service and delicious food! Would definitely recommend this fabulous restaurant!
"I have eaten here a couple of times when in London on business. It isn't Turkish fine dining, but it offers a relatively informal eating area with no waiting around. The menu has quite a lot of choice with most of the things you would expect. The portions are a reasonable size, the price fair and the staff friendly. I will certainly eat here again."
"We visited over the weekend with our toddler, and we were very pleasantly surprised by how amazing it was! From the friendly service down to the relaxed decor, we could not find a fault. They serve warm soda bread, that had me swooning (I am not a usual fan of bread), and don't be fooled by the simple menu. They deliver in quality, taste and aesthetics, it felt like we were lunching at a Michelin-starred restaurant, but paying gastro pub prices. I had a gorgeous dish of fishcakes (with bacon and samphire), and my husband had a lovely ""ravioli"" that turned out to be so beautiful, we had to admire it for a couple of minutes before he dug in (absolutely diveine goat's cheese). Even our son's ""burger and chips"" was delicious, I ate his leftovers! Child friendly, relaxed, beautiful beer-garden out the back, very friendly service. Loved that they had Radio4 on in the toilets! Highly recommended for a lazy weekend lunch. We will be back."
"This is a very traditional London pub, in a great location, the food is pub grub but good. The pub gets packed on a Friday."
"Food good, when it came. Slow and confused service. Had to ask for things several times, including the bill and card machine. Poor gentleman next to me had his bill presented to him twice wihtout asking."
"For being a fine dining the place does not use good or effective kitchen vacuums/air fan and my clothes got very smelly, which I ate and for which I normally prefer fine diveing over Japanese fast food restaurants.The beef was mixed, good and not. one piece did not taste good at all, I guess they include some non fresh meat in the course?Even if you chose medium rare meat, still it comes medium well instead, because it's served on a hot stone. Not enough chance to take it away on time..Toilette can be more clean tooIn conclusion an overpriced restaurant. Can find the same quality elsewhere for cheaper price.The place is small and table reservation is highly recommended"
"I ate here whilst on a London theatre break with my mum. The food was delicious and reasonably priced (bear in mind you are in central London and nowhere, repeat NOWHERE is cheap!). The restaurant is very well located for those visiting London theatres, Covent Garden or Trafalgar Square.The staff were very friendly & helpful without ever being overbearing and although the service was quick, at no time did either of us feel rushed.I had the spinach & ricotta cannelloni (which was lovely) & Mum had the lasagne which she said was delicious.Loved the ""shot desserts""! These were tiny desserts served in shot glasses. You can choose to have 3 or 5 shots. Great if you want something sweet but can't manage a whole dessert or if (like me) you like to try several different desserts.The restaurant is larger than it looks with a huge downstairs area which you can't see from the street.Word of warning.....get there before about 12.45 as come 1o'clock it really starts to fill up."
very silent at times .excelent for just sitting back and watching london pass by .seating not free . would have to eat in or have a drink or two
"My pal and I visited 3pm last Saturday afternoon. What a delightful pub. Lots of choice of ales at great prices. Fairly full,lots of atmosphere,wonderful old style decor. I wish I could take this pub home with, me it is perfect."
We thought this quite a special place at reasonable prices for central city London lunch. Normally we don't like going downstairs but this has been very nicely done and they have created a very attractive and friendly dining environment. Food in French bistro style was authentic and very well-prepared and presented. I would have no hesitations in recommending the restaurant for a business lunch or for catching up with friends.
.......this is the place to come.Visited Hawksmoor with American clients who wanted somewhere to eat steak. They were not disappointed. From the off this place impresses. Friendly staff and a really nice bar area for a drink beforehand. The party piece is the blackboard featuring your choice of cuts of meat. Nothing else got a look in but other reviews are testament to some good other choices if you want to venture beyond steak. Some good choices of wine were also in evidence - some nice Rioja went done well.All in all a great experience. Will definitely be back.
"A place full of festive cheer,And a fabulously bizarre range of beer,You'll remember the smell of the hand soap,Whatever you ask for, the staff always cope,They are friendly and attentive but not in your face,The food is hearty, unique and full of taste,It's romantic, cosy and full of charm,For EC2A, there's surprisingly no smarm,The manager Dan, he knows his stuff,I'll be back again, can't get enough,The Princess of Shoreditch, it sure is fine,Especially over 3 bottles of wine."
Local Pub that now does Pizzas in purpose-made oven. Nice atmosphere and decor. Will do well once they get into a pattern.JLR score: 30/50
Had a lovely meal here yesterday with my husband! Food was fantastic! They cooked our steaks perfectly!Love the cocktails here too! Staff always very helpful! Food great!
"I was surprised to see so many glowing reviews for this place - it was tasty but nothing to rave about. I was heading to Leon in Leadenhall Market and walked past here and thought I'd try it instead. For £5.25 I expected more than chicken, a few piece of courgette and salad leaves. The chicken was nice but it was supposed to be cajun and didn't really have any cajun flavourings. If you order food here I'd suggest getting a side otherwise you'll leave hungry - this does push the price up to the edge of the acceptable limit for what is essentially fast food. The food did come quickly which is great but there's a lot of competition in this area and I'd try other places before returning here."
"First time in this restaurant chain. Discovered we had a free kir voucher on back of theatre ticket, so reserved seats here before the show. Glad we did as it became crowded. Pre-theatre menu was lovely especially the couscous with roast veg and yoghurt. After another glass of wine we were ready for the theatre. Service was professional; would come again even without free kir!"
"We had lunch here today. John had the Chicken, bacon and avocado healthy choice salad and I had the Tikka skewers with yogurt & salad. The service was really quick and friendly. We only wanted a light lunch but there was plenty of it and very nicely cooked. As this was originally an old bank it is an enormous and impressive room with lots of room to stretch out and enjoy a meal. Lovely"
A very hidden restaurant in a small alley in Hampstead village off Heath Street. That restaurant also owns a pizzeria a few meters away and is always full as the prices are reasonable and very close to Everyman cinema. Villa Bianca is one of my favourite London hidden places where food comes first before any media frenzy makes it popular. Real food for real people!
"The Kobe burgers were good but expensive - not sure why you would make Kobe beef into burgers in the first place and it didn't taste much different to the mince I use to make my own burgers.The restaurant felt over decorated and fussy and the mirrored ceiling was odd and didn't contribute anything to the dining experience, except to make me wonder why.The staff were friendly and accommodating when we added another member to our party halfway through the meal."
I was at a friend's house 5 minutes away from the restaurant but we had to wait 1 hour 20 minutes for a pizza delivery. The pizza wasn't cooked properly and we had to put it in the oven for 10 minutes. Even then the dough was still soggy.Definitely wasn't worth the money. I would avoid this establishment. Far better pizzas to be had in the area.
"Stayed in the Ibis Hotel opposite.... and that's another story! Popped into the Mitre not expecting much and came away very content. Beautifully cooked and seasoned full bream for only 14 quid, absolute bargain for Greenwich. It did help that they have a wide range of cask ales and lagers. I will definitely go there again."
"Since food is very expensive in London, this chain of restaurants allows you to eat within a reasonable budget. We visited many stores and food was fresh and delicious everywhere. This is a very good option."
"I have never had anything but totally amazing and delicious food at the Green Pea. As mentioned in so many other reviews, Tom's pies are to die for. In fact all the food I have had here is to die for!! All of it home made and fresh. Tom is a great character and will make you feel really welcome. Another bonus is you probably won't need to eat for the rest of the day!!"
"Lovely menu, most options allow a choice between large and small portions, small being quite generous. Food fabulous. Will definitely be going back."
"Had a fantastic evening at Vasis on the 28th October. Food, service and atmosphere were perfect. Thanks to the team at Vasis for making my wife's birthday dinner a success."
"I had a lovely dinner with friends. The welcoming and reactive waiting staff, the delicious dishes (I particularly enjoyed the sirloin steak, cooked to perfection, and the generous cafe gourmand for dessert) and the Parisian-like atmosphere all combined into a delightful experience. I wholeheartedly recommend it!!!"
"Following a great night at the theatre my partner and I called in here because I had a craving for pasta. We asked to sit outside and were told that after 11pm it is not allowed, although it was only 10.20pm I didn't argue. We ordered food, I ordered an oven baked pasta dish which should have been a mix of crispy pancetta chicken cheese and pasta. When the meals Arrived I was told not to touch the metal dish as it will be piping hot, I took a mouthful and the food was stone cold, I then picked up the piping hot dish and it too was cold. I asked the waiter to get another one, he was very apologetic and took it away returned with some free bread. 10 minutes later my partner had finished eating and my oven baked dish returned. The second offering from the kitchen was warmer they had clearly shoved some extra bits in and put it back in the oven. The pancetta looked like raw chicken it was so not crispy, the two tiny pieces of chicken I managed to hunt out through the vast amount of undercooked chewy pasta.I was underwhelmed and so annoyed I asked the waiter to take t away and he asked me if I would like to speak to the manager I said I did, eventually she came to the table I explained that the food was not great that my partner ate alone ten I was served my meal and that it wasn't really acceptable. She did not at all apologise but said she would take it off the bill. We asked for the bill and when it Arrived she had given us a 30% discount which didn't even equate to half of the cost of the disgusting dish. We called the waiter and he rectified and we left. I am sure this is not the standard expected at bella Italia and I will not return to the restaurant, we were not the only table complaining of cold food either!"
"Busy and lively when I visited for dinner with my daughter on Monday evening. We didn't realise it was a Ramsey restaurant until we looked at the menu. The food was very good, my daughter had fish and chips which were tasty. I ordered lamb, which Arrived almost raw! and I had to send back for a little more cooking. I should have been asked how I wanted it cooked! But my huge disappointment was being charged 15 Pounds for a glass of wine!!! ok I should have studied the wine list, but I just said I would have a glass of Chardonnay, I wasn't offered the house wine, which I discovered later was £6.50 a glass, it was only when the bill Arrived (and the waitress did look a little uncomfortable as she handed me the bill) that I saw I had paid £30.00 for wine. Mr. Ramsey I can imagine how you would feel if you were ripped off. I won't be back ‰÷_•ü"
"We got the 4 dishes and bottomless drinks deal from Open table. The food was really nice but the best part was the interactive menu projected directly onto the table with the classic pong game and some drawing apps, was a nice modern touch will return."
Love this for eating with my kids. They can't wait to go back for salami lollipops and special ice cream. Great fun atmosphere too!
"The service was perfect, we Arrived early to have a drink in the bar, we were seated at our table on time ( on a very busy Saturday evening), the waiter ran through the menu in great detail and was very attentive all evening with out being over bearing.All courses were cooked perfectly and tasted as good as they looked.What a perfect way to celebrate."
Visited this restaurant based on several reviews and online recommendations.Food was very average and service below par. There are much better places in the vicinity if your looking for solid cooking and service.The menu here isn't executed well
"The place was half empty when visited so service was good , food was ok but to my personal taste very bland . Others might find this very western Chinese more to their taste"
"We had dinner here 2 times and it was soooo good! When you first enter the place it can be a bit off-putting because the decor and size are not the best. But the atmosphere is very nice and relaxed. It has that feeling of a family run restaurant which I actually think it is.I recommend the fried goat cheese as a starter (if you like goat cheese) and the pate. Deeelicious!As mains, we had lamb, pork liver and steak, which all come with potatoes and broccoli as sides. Big portions and tasty.As always, I tried the chocolate cake which was very good.All in all, we will be returning there as the service was absolutely amazing and the food did not disappoint.Nice music too!"
"A pleasant surprise, can't think of anywhere better to spend a sunny afternoon! Food was yummy and the service was quick and efficient. A little bit confusing getting to the top deck but the staff were more than helpful and explained that they were redecorating upstairs. Lovely afternoon, would thoroughly recommend."
"I had eaten at this chain on previous trips and hoped that it had retained the same high quality as before. I was not disappointed. We are a mixed family of meat eaters and vegetarians and everyone always found what they wanted. The sandwiches are always fresh, delicious and with high quality ingredients. The breakfast were very good also and the price is right.You are never very far from one of their shops.I wish they were in the U.S. - sigh!"
What a wonderful restaurant. Great food. Great service. Great ambience. And great prices too boot. The bestTry the mushy peas with fish and chips
"Came across the Alice House on the way to meeting friends for dinner elsewhere, but was very greatly taken aback by how lovely this place was. We were warmly welcomed by the manager, Joe, who made sure that we had everything we needed; including a little extra top up of my partners wine after he split some by accident(!).Will definitely return in the near future."
"Great pizza, full of flavour, loaded on top with basil, very cheap. We had the meat , dearest pizza was £7.95, whole meal was £25.00 for two and I couldn't finish it all."
"I love coming here for the savoury cakes.They have a good variety and they are always fresh, you just need to come at the right time to make sure you can get some as they do sometimes run out!!"
"i love having a scent pie and mash shop on my door step, which as I live in the east end shouldn't be a problem, but these days it's harder than you think!I could try and explain the appeal of this type of food, but unless you grew up with it you wouldn't get it!Needless to say, love this place!"
"The Terrace Restaurant is on the first floor above the popular riverside pub, The White Hart in Barnes. Quite a large place with and adventurous menu, that 'works'. Starters from £7.50 to £9, mains from £14 to £22, supplementing them, a range of different cuts of steaks are offered daily, there are four desserts and a cheese board to finish. They also have a large wine list. Service was friendly, attentive and efficient. Our group had three different main dishes, all were well cooked, nicely presented, generous portions and were delicious. We had a very pleasant evening and would return to the Terrace for another meal there."
Lunch time special delishous. Girlie afternoon fne. But men. Don't think would appreciate small portions. Other than that yummiest
"Went here after a full busy day in London, atmosphere very good they do play loud music however that is what you expect in this kind of restaurant as they do it every single one. Food is a good price for what you get, cocktails are very nice they do a big selection. Also have quite a lot of promos on the app as I had a free appetiser so we had mozzarella sticks to share (they were a single portion) but they come with 5 and they are very big so well worth the money."
Incredibly friendly and cosy environment to sit in and have your delicious Indian food. The food has just the right amount of spices for people to enjoy without resorting to water. Service is courteous and fast and price is very reasonable for the location. Very impressed. Five stars.
"very nice room, good service. Dishes have generous size and meet expectation, without getting you over-excited. Nice & classy. What you would expect from a chic burger joint. Desserts are great"
I came here earlier in the week for lunch and loved it so much came back 3 days later for dinner. Both times had delicious food and great service! Can't recommend it enough!
"Rules is London's oldest restaurant and never fails to delight. Great location, super food and even better service. This is very old world so make sure that's what you want - think Consomme and Game Pie and you're getting there. But they have modern additions which are all delicious. Make sure you have a cocktail upstairs as the drinks and service are excellent and it's like going back in time - 100 years. Rules costs a bit but in my view worth every cent if you love traditional, comfortable surroundings with great service."
"This is a great Sushi restaurant, small inside but perfectly formed. We regularly eat here and have take-aways. I wish they provided take-aways more than just thurs, fri, sat and sun though as I have to go elsewhere the rest of the week.Soft shell crab is awesome."
"Normally I start the heading by assessing the food. But I remember best the heading. We were five friends having a late dinner after a West Ham match ‰_Õ we wanted Indian style dinner, and I called and booked a table one hour in advance. Very friendly staff! I took a Tikka Chicken Masala with rice and nan. It was good, but expected a bit more genuine taste in this cozy tiny family driven restaurant. Normally I would have rated this one more star, but that was before going to the toilet..terrible hygiene! Then you start wondering about the kitchen upstairs. Time to renovate is my clear advise."
"We like this place, when visiting Portobello we often pop in for lunch, food is always good, as is service, great value for money and always tastes authentic which we like."
Found out about the green pea on trip advisor. Tom is a great man and the food did not disappoint think a menu would help the hard of hearing and foreigners as Tom only tells you once and ads his humour in the process will return as had a great meal of lamb shank friends had various pies but did not go for his signature pie of steak & horse radish which he gave a sample and they agreed it was good didn't have starters or desserts 4 main meals cost £51.00 not including drinks as we got them from the bar next door so not expensive every one enjoyed the food and venue and will all return thank you Tom & staff at the green pea
"It's one of my favorite London's restaurants. History, entourage, excellent chef and kitchen. Unfortunately, maÌ¨tre d'hÌ«tel and waiter who served our table were quite unaffable, but food and atmosphere in Rules are so good that this great restaurant deserves the best rating."
I have used this restaurant as a take-away only for many years and love the quality of the food. Excellent!!
Good range of food available at reasonable prices. Goats curd and honey especially delicious. Recommend ordering a bunch of plates and sharing
"Food is good quality. However it's on a bit to the expensive end and choices are quite limited. Having visited Korea and knowing its variety of delicacies, Kimchee should bring out new dishes occasionally"
"Fabulous food, pies are absolutely amazing and everything else is fantastic too. Portions are huge!! Tom is a fantastic host - a meal you will remember..."
"We've been fortunate enough to dine at the hands of Nigel Mendham once before at DUKES HOTEL and were more than excited to head back for an intimate evening with the chef, to sample what he had lined up for the new year in 2016. If you aren't aware, THIRTY SIX By Nigel Mendham is the signature restaurant at Mayfair's luxury DUKES LONDON and they have recently unveiled a brand new British Larder menu concept. Inspired by his love of traditional British recipes and the country's quality ingredients, Nigel has created a calendar of field to table culinary delights, set to change on a monthly basis, in line with the seasons.Each month, the British Larder menu offers diners the chance to sample a different British dish, inspired by locally sourced and foraged ingredients from around the country. Whether it's warming them up in the colder months with rich game dishes and sumptuous winter truffles or taking them in to spring with refreshing tastes such as delicate shellfish, lobster and mouth-watering lamb, we can vouch on Nigel's behalf, that diners will be wowed with every mouthful!Nigel is well known for his contemporary British food, but is now eager to share his passion for the dishes and ingredients that Brits know and love best, using techniques and recipes passed through the generations. For our evening, we were taken on a culinary journey full of winter flavours, starting with a delicate starter of Artichoke with Confit Duck Egg, Autumn Truffle and Duck Ham, presented beautifully with the perfect amount of seasoning for that rich little Duck Egg.Following on from our starter, Nigel continued with the winter theme and produced another brilliant looking plate, this time the arrangement consisted of Whole Roast Partridge with Game Chips, Bread Sauce, Parsnip & Sprouting Broccoli. Having been brought up in a West Country village, we always get excited about game as it reminds us of the rolling hills of home and this dish certainly lived up to expectations. The combination of flavours worked beautifully on the palate and the Game Chips were an inspired addition!To finish, it was all about the brilliant English Apple. As you know we love this ingredient, whether it be for consumption in food or a delicious drop of cider. Nigel had incorporated Brogdale Apples for the final dish and served them with Apple Sorbet, Goat's Curd & Compressed Apple. If we're honest with ourselves, when first reading the menu, we were slightly unsure of the inclusion of the Goat's Curd but we knew we should trust Nigel's knowledge of flavours, as just like the Game Chips, it was the ingredient that bound the rest together and marked the dish with that memorable moment of a new taste sensation that you would be discussing on your journey home and the next day with friends.British Larder Menu at Thirty six by Nigel Mendham Dukes HotelIf you fancy sampling Nigel's British Larder Menu in 2016, here is what you can expect over the coming months:JanuaryClassic Pudding - £8.00÷To Keep Out The Cold'Pineapple ÷Upside Down' Cake Ò Coconut CustardFebruaryFish & Chips - £16.00÷Childhood Memories'Haddock Ò Chips Ò KetchupMarchShellfish - £28.00÷Posh Nosh'Lobster ThermidorAprilLamb - £21.00÷Spring Time'Lamb Cutlets Ò Jersey Royals Ò AsparagusEnjoy!We The Food Snobs x"
"We have been visiting Gallipoli for years to celebrate birthdays and special occasions! The food and cocktails are delicous!! The atmosphere is lively, vibrant and fun. When its your birthday they make a real fuss of you, and make your night so special! I would highly recommend coming here with family, or for a romatic date! You wont be sorry!"
I was looking for a real Italian restaurant in London near Edgeware Rd. Stuzzico is a place with fine kitchen and wines. The staff and the owner let you to feel really welcomed. Moreover prices are good.
"Good authentic local pub recently revamped (summer 2014) now serving Oysters and chops. We've been 3 times in the last month and the food is really pretty good - modern/classic British. Fresh oysters, great selection of local beers, and friendly restaurant staff and eager to please. It's busy with a good mixed crowd but you can get away from in the dining room. Recent understated upgrade retaining lots of its original late 19c features."
Called in to this restaurant on the way back to the station. The service was very good especially as the place was heaving but the food was not up to the usual standard.
This is a quite authentic Greek taverna and does make you feel like you've stepped onto a Greek Island somewhere. We started with dips and flat bread and they seemed to be homemade with quality ingredients. The mixed grill took a little while to arrive and was cooked to perfection with really great chips on the side. A good selection of wines including some good Greek choices and very friendly service. All in all good value and very tasty food. We'll come again!
"wow what a find....a friend recommended this restaurant to me, wish I had known it was there before! so many choices for vegetarians...the food is amazing. I had never tried lebanese food before and there are so many gorgeous choices."
Thoroughly enjoyed my visit here last night. There were 8 of us so we had the set menu. It was really nicely presented and tasted great. The food was plentiful and it felt like it just kept coming. It was £60 a head with a glass of prossecco which covers the entertainment too. I thought it was exellent value for money and the drinks were no more expensive in the same part of London at £4.50 for a beer. I am sure you would need to pre book as it was packed in there.
"Great service and great food! I had souffle to start and Lamb chops for main course with a couple of glasses of wine. really nice, i'll be back soon!"
"Pret a Manger seems to be on every corner in London and what a great place for a healthy fast food option. They serve lattes, cappuccinos, organic teas, fruit smoothies, fruit infusions, pastries, sandwiches, soup of the day, fresh fruit cups, fresh bananas and apples etc. Everything is made daily using natural ingredients. The sandwiches and soups were amazing and I wish I had more time to sample the fantastic pastry choices. Hopefully this chain will move across ""the pond""."
"Spent 5 hours here absolutely excellent , would return tomorrow so interesting , needed more time as missed some of the attractions . Fantastic value for money and well organised . Became involved in the siege which was great fun especially when rotten veg and chamber pot contents were thrown at intruders ."
"We booked our table for 12 and got a prompt confirmation. We were adviced to go as early as possible so as not to be disappointed as the kitchen closes at 10. Two of our friends would be arriveing late and we placed the order, it was prepared in advance and was attended to by the chefs even though the guests Arrived after 10. Both dishes did not lack in taste or presentation and everyone was equally satisfied by their meal."
"It could have been a bit sunnier and warmer, but at least it wasn't raining. We had been allocated the rear Out-deck. There were about 20 of us. We had booked for drinks and canapes. The evening got off to a slow start, with guests arriveing in trickles. Those of us who Arrived early amused ourselves poking fun at guests arriveing later negotiating the steep downward ramp onto the boat (not friendly towards high heels). I was immediately impressed when I boarded, by noting the efficient signposting of directions to join my party on the upper deck. the manager on duty James was extremely helpful, and all the staff were cheerful and friendly, and keen to help us all have a good time. This dovetails well with my experience of a very efficient booking exercise and help with tailoring the event by Natasha(events co-ordinator). I would recommend it as an excellent venue for a unique party experience."
Again another voucher from KGBdeals. We have been to this joint venture between Marco Pierre White and Frankie dettori many times and it never fails. The steak really is the best I have had in london. Service very good. Looking a little tired in places.
"We went this Italian erstaurant near to our hotel for dinner. As we did not have reservation we were directed to a table outside on the sidewalk. We ordered a seafood pasta with a big prawn and a seafood risotto. Both were really good. They are comparable to the quality of food we ate in Italy. There is so much flavours in the pasta sauce. The risotto was very tasty as well, though I like the pasta more. The service was very good. With a bottled water we ordered, the bill came to 36 British pounds, 12.5% service charge already included."
Having eaten here some years ago (which was okay I think ... but obviously not particularly memorable) it has become a favourite place to grab a drink before enjoying a show at the Albert Hall. Small and cosy with friendly staff and a little rock and roll memorabilia to enjoy too.
"We went a couple of nights ago for a ""working meal"" after a recommendation. It was very quiet and we didn't need to book a table. The service was excellent although a bit too quick at times. We had a shared platter for starters and followed by two mains and two round of drinks and the bill came to £63. In summary, great food, excellent service but a little pricey."
"Even from outside the place look very small & not so much attracting the food is really tasty. The best Korean food I ever had. Bibimbap, bulgogi & kimchi were delicious. Staff very friendly. I definitely suggest it if you want to taste real Korean food."
"After a long day in London we were in desperate need of something to eat and somewhere to sit down and relax. Our last stop was visiting Trafalgar Square so we decided that this place would be ideal. I rang up very last minute at 7.30 and was able to book a table for 5 at 8.15 as requested with no problems and the lady was very polite on the phone. When we got to the restaurant, the staff were very welcoming and showed us to our table, this is my only fault as the table was a round one pushed up against a rectangle one so there was a bit of a tight squeeze but we got round it ok. The waitresses were very polite and helpful and the food was good quality for Frankie and Bennys. Especially as two of the people in the group are quite fussy eaters and needed their burgers made a certain way without some of the sauces and items that were listed on the menu. In other places the staff have failed to get this simple order correct, however the meals came out just the way we asked and were delicious. My sister had also asked for another glass of tap water, and the waitress was so observant that she kindly brought over a jug of ice cold water with glasses for everyone, which I thought was very good of her. We went on a Monday evening so we got 25% off our food bill which made it fantastic value for money considering the prices are pretty good on food anyway. I would rate this restaurant higher then our usual Frankie and Bennys in Ipswich as the service was fantastic and the food was also delicious. The only improvement could be to rearrange the tables a little better. Thank you for a lovely time."
"Ok pub, good cider and proximity of Spitalfields market - across the road. Known for its links with Jack the Ripper was surprised there is no mention of it in the pub itself - great pork scratchings although a little pricey - £2.60 for a cup full!"
The food was all lovely. Really good fresh sashimi. The staff were very friendly & helpful. The only negative is they have very limited wine selection.
"I took my friend to the Hispaniola for her Birthday for a Three course meal with sparkling wine.The effort made was fantastic, the food delicious . Our waitress lou was a credit to the management .The time and effort put into the meal was worth it a credit to the chef.The restaurant was quiet this lunchtime but the atmosphere was good. We had service at the appropriate times without being obtrusive. we would highly recommend this 3 courses cost 28.00 each plus drinks. Great views of the london eye."
We were lucky enough to get here at 6pm and walked straight in but noticed when we left an hour of so later there was a queue. The food was excellent. I had Lamb Shanks with Cauliflower Puree and my husband had Chicken. They were both excellent. Had a couple of drinks but felt a little like we should be on the move as it was so popular and they were getting people in and out as quick as possible. To be expected I suppose when the place is so popular
"Looking for a late breakfast venue , came across this delightful brasserie. The breakfast was delicious and the service impeccable. Well recommended ."
"Went there to try out their lunch menu. Overall, the food was mediocre and not worth the money. The lunch set cost either 30 or 40 pounds for a variety of Sashimi, Kobe beef and some random dishes. However, I do not recommend you to come here as the food is highly overpriced and is lack of flavour. The Kobe beef was a complete disappointment. Not only did it lack lustre, it tasted like any other common beef on the market. Overall, the service and ambience of the restaurant was good but the food definitely did not meet my expectation."
"I have been to the Colony Club for drinks with friends a couple of times. Both times, we were very satisfied with the quality of cocktails and the selection of champagne and wine, but a bit disappointed with the quality of the service.Last time, we ordered a bottle of champagne and when we asked for the bill, we were charged more than 10£ extra, compared to the price on the drinks list. This was excluding service charge. When we asked for clarification, we were told they had applied a ""after 11pm"" charge, of which we were never informed.Moreover, we ordered our drinks way before 11, it was 10:30pm when we did, but the waitress insisted on making us pay this charge.She then understood we were not wiling to pay for it and took it off the bill. It was a bit frustrating and ruined our excellent impression of the bar.It's a shame because, if the staff were friendlier, this bar could become a massive Mayfair hotspot for drinks."
Went to this wine bar for dinner 2 weeks ago and even though it was busy the service was excpetional we had a drink at the bar and some nuts and olives all served v quickly then we moved to our table when it was the time we had booked for. I had lamb which was exceptional but my friend wasn't too keen on his rib eye it did look rather small. The veggies were lovely nice and crips and everything was well presented. I dopped a knife and it was replaced immediately would go back here for the fantastic service alone. Attentive but not overbearing. Highly recommended.
"We all went wanting to try somewhere new and heard about Good Earth. The food was just about ok nothing exceptional about any of the dishes we tried. We had an extensive selection of the starters and main courses. Being big fans of Chinese food we unequiveocally agreed that the food was mediocre at best ... overpriced at worst. Service was fast which was the redeeming feature but with difficult parking not adding to the overall experience, I do not think we will be returning."
"I went with my 2 kids (5 and 1year) yesterday and they reserved a very comfortable place for my kids.Also, the food was brilliant!! I ordered prawn tempura, salmon sushi, Korean hot dishes etc... quite a lot of food...It was very fresh and the taste was Ummmmmmmm yami...The waters and waitresses were so friendly and gave a warm smile to my kids. During we were having a meal, it was very comfortable and satisfied.I definitely go again soon!!"
"This place is one of my favourite places to eat in Shepherd's Bush. They have earned every one of their 5 stars. The staff are friendly, the food good and is really affordable.ive been to Thailand several times and the food served at Jasmine is very authentic.Insider tip: their best dish is the ""Vegetables/Chicken on Fire"", you won't regret it!"
Very fresh seafood and a quality Italian menu made for a memorable Sunday lunch with friends today. The attentive waiting staff coped well with well behaved but active kids all topped off with a live pianist. Definitely recommended.
"Mostly a chicken joint with many varieties of serving up grilled chicken. Food was ok, nothing special. Lot's of choices for hot sauces if this is your thing. There are multiple locations in London so maybe this was the experience for this location only."
"Great meal , very reasonable , with great staff , partner had mixed grill and i had pasta both great free soft drink top ups too ,"
"Can't fault the service with a smile but didn't rate the food that much. And for the price, I don't think it's worth it. Calamari good, polvo a galego wasn't very tasty, the albondigas were warmish and the croquettas weren't great either and I found quite a bit of fatty bits of meat"
"Uli is still in ""soft opening"", having opened its doors mid-August in this popular corner of Notting Hill. The decor is fresh and pleasant - white, turquoise, blue...clean lines and simple crockery/cutlery. The outside terrace is a plus on a good weather day, and it helps balance the tiny (but perfectly formed) interiors. The menu is thoughtful - the list of dishes fits on one page and is not overwhelming as sometimes Chinese menu can be, which makes diners wish well (better to have few, but well prepared dishes). With regards to food, it is good and reliable, although perhaps not the finest we've tried. The crispy duck was tasty, chicken with basil and chilli interesting and schezuan prawns big and juicy - although lacking a bit of bite. the service was friendly, although a bit chaotic - as imaginable in opening week! Overall a good experience, and we will be back to try in a month or so when the dust settles..."
"Visited early October for our anniversary. Think this is our fifth visit and it just gets better and better. The food, staff, service are first class. Value for money is excellent. We were even treated to petty fours as an anniversary treat which was so kind and thoughtful. Can't wait to return to this beautiful restaurant."
"If you want to have the feeling of London, you must go to Rules at least once in your lifetime (once you go, you'll want to return. Great food with classic dishes and a very cozy ambiance.I am a big fan. Been there a few times but hope to return every visit I make to London."
"Freud is a hole-in-the-wall cocktail bar and cafe in the Covent Garden area of London. It's easy to miss, but if you go down the stairs be prepared for a wonderful range of cocktails and an intimate environment. The staff are always very upbeat and friendly as well which is refreshing in the often dour city of London itself. I tend to pop in whenever I am in the area for a quick drink or two (rarely more as they tend to go for £7-8 per drink). Definitely worth checking out!"
"If one has a hearing issue, then it would be a nice venue for a reasonable meal at very competitive price. The set menu is really good value for money despite the fact that it only changes once a month. One can choose to have 2 or 3 courses for under £20 excluding drinks. The a-la-carte menu offers quite a wide range of choices for starters & main courses. The pan-fried duck breast is commendable. The home-made creme brÌÈlee is their signature dessert (smooth & creamy). However, the service is just average due to shortage of staff serving high numbers of diners. Be advised that conversation is totally impossible due to the extremely noisy ambiance. Experience it for yourself!"
"We had an wonderful evening there. We had no specific opinion of the restaurant before getting there and were very positively suprised by the atmosphere, the food (and drinks) and the staff. It is really a place to go to enjoy good quality and delicious dishes. Staff is also very friendly (but professional) which add to the experience. A place to go, absolutely"
"Met here for a friends birthday for food and drinks, had scampi and chips good food but not amazing by all means. But very good warm feel to the pub and a cracking atmosphere, not the greatest selection of beers but had enough to satisfy us. Later when a dj turned up the place had a good vibe and throughly enjoyed myself, although getting a proper dance floor or moving chairs would be advisable as not a lot of room for dancing, but very satisfied will definitely try come here again."
Great atmosphere and really cool jazz band in the back room on a Friday. Loved it. Will be returning.
"this is the kind of place that you find in a lucky day, its hidden in a basement accross the road from forbidden planet(for all the comic fans out there). Great drinks and extremely good prices for the location that you are in. it can get very busy at weekends and the service might get very slow, but if you happen to be near at the beginning of the week is well worth the visit. The only downside is the very steep staircase at the entrance which can get quite dangerous if you are a bit drunk."
"Fantastic menu, Cozy setting, Excellent service. Had the wolfes burger its huge couldnt manage to finish it, But mouth watering!"
"We were new to Lebanese cuisine, and so we tried the platter which had a broad choice of foods from Lebanese cooking.We were surprised by how refreshing the flavours were. Everything was so fresh - the Fattoush salad was delicious, the Hummus was so creamy and the Garlic dip and Chili dip should be bottled and sold.We were enthralled by the flavours of the falafel and vine leaf parcels. And were really happy and satisfied.Then!... our waiter (who smiled all the time) brought us a platter or meats - chicken and lamb cubes barbecued and chichen and lamb shaurmas. The meat was delicious - and really meat (there was not 'reconstituted' ground meat with spices here). Finally we had baklavi, fruit and black tea with mint. We will be trying the black tea with fresh mint at home again! A great combination of flavours. I didn't get to enjoy the baklava as my wife refuse to share - she did tell me they were delicious. We had a wonderful 2 hours with the Phoenicia restaurant. The kitchen is out front and the chefs are a hive of jolly chaos. The waiting staff are always busy, but always smiling. The old guys out front are joyful! And the toilets are spotless."
"If you are looking for a place that is all about the food - this is a place to go.Went with a friend of Friday around 7pm as we were around Old Street Roundabout and the place is nearby.We were lucky as we did not have to wait too long for a table and the weather was nice (The place is small so the queue outside builds up quickly).The food was great - true flavors ans came quickly. The two of us took one rice dish, one buns dish and a small bowl of Koren Fried Chicken and were full! Even though the dishes do not look that big they are really filling.The service is minimal which I guess fits the whole concept."
"Cosy. Sounds like there is an upstairs, but didn't look like it was open. So sat downstairs. A little cramped but not a problem. Nice atmosphere - fantastically fresh, genuine tapas. Would definitely recommend."
"A lovely restaurant. Very tasty food with excellent options for dietary needs, which for me is very important. Staff were genuinely friendly and helpful. Metti was very welcoming and personable. Nice to be able to sit out in the sun and people watch. Would definitely come again!"
"Went here on a Thursday night and the place had a cool ambience. Had to wait half an hour for a table which was expected so had some cocktails while we waited. There was a good selection to chose from, I had a gin cocktail which was awesome, highly recommended!The menu has a good selection and were told that 4-5 dishes would suffice. We went for the Gorgonzola pizza with prosciutto which was amazing, classic meatballs, garlic and chili prawns, beef ragu and rocket salad. Couldn't fault it at all really, although nothing blew me away.I would recommend this place, reasonably priced, good atmosphere and tasty food."
Staff/owner extremely pleasant and welcoming. The food was good but have had nicer Carribean.. Sorry! We had mutton curry and jerk chicken with rice and peas. We had salt fish to start off with.Would recommend for takeout as portions were massive and probably good to reheat left overs!
Booked a table through bookatable. £28 autumn menu plus glass of prosecco. Beautiful restaurant. Food was to die for. Lovely surroundings (right opposite millennium wheel) staff polite and chatty and remembered that I had said when booking that it was out anniversary. Tried the cocktails and they were lush. Will definitely go again and defo recommend it. Five stars. If in London it's right opposite the embankment station or down the road from charing cross station. 5 mins from Big Ben and other attractions.
"I was invited here to dinner by a friend.I had passed it a couple of times being an almost daily visitor along Haymarket and thought to try it out, but this was my first visit.What surprised me the most, is this restaurant has been here for 4 years. I thought it had just opened.We ordered the set menu, excellent value at £19 for 2 courses including a free cocktail (the cocktail only available when booking online via Opentable or the like).Service was a little hap hazard but amicable.The White onion mouse with Sour Dough Bread was extremely good, the meatballs, light but not as flavoursome as I would have liked, but nonetheless well done.The salmon main was a disappointment unfortunately. Again lacking in flavour in the fish and the seasoning. But my friend raved about her steak and her chips seemed reasonable.I tried the Masala Mai Tai Cocktail, that was well blended but felt unnecessary and gimmicky, hence the title of this review. There's a lot good to say about this place, it has a good vibe, nicely laid out, perfectly located for tourists without being a tourist trap. From my visit they need to improve the service quality quite significantly though and get back to the basics when it comes to food & cocktails.But definitely worth a drop in, especially if you can get the Meal & Cocktail deal."
"Fabulous cosy restaurant, fantastic food preferences with a varied authenticmenu, a pleasant surprise that will not break the bank"
"Recently went here for the first time and really enjoyed it. Good value, delicious food, quick service and a great selection. Will be visiting again!"
Now the Switch House is open it has made a good gallery really special. The new space itself is sensational with great spaces and windows and fantastic concrete angles and views everywhere. Take the lift from the bottom to the tenth floor and the 360 degree view from outside the top floor is one of the best and free! The people in the expensive penthouses next door are not happy though! A great peep at how the other half live!Walk down the stairs and take in the new gallery floors on the way down after eating or drinking on the ninth floor again with great views. Another stunning way to spend half a day for no cost.
"Nice looking place, we had a nice waiter. The mains were not great though, their tofu is not good. Went to use the ladies before leaving, opened the door and stepped straight into a huge puddle and slipped. Luckily I did not fall. The leak was coming out of the toilet. I thought I would do the responsible thing and let them know so someone else didn't break their neck. Unfortunately the lady at the bar was more than put out that this had been brought to her attention, obviously again. She threw her hands up and said she already knew, but basically they didn't have time to deal with it. Given the hazard, the breach in health and safety, the potential for someone to have a serious accident and the fact they were aware and had done nothing, I thought this was pretty awful. I won't be back."
"We stumbled across the White Hart on a cold and very wet Wednesday afternoon. In search of somewhere for a pot of tea / coffee we made our way into this old coaching inn - the oldest licensed premises in London evidently.Sitting at the rear in what we presume was originally the porch through which the stage coaches drove to deposit passengers out of the rain (how apt) - now thankfully closed in, but the archways still visible and the vaulted ceiling towering above we perused the menu.It became evident that this was no ordinary pub fare on offer. We decided to eat and ordered the home made mushroom soup and a toasted ham, cheese & tomato toasties, plus tea and coffee.Large pots of tea and a generous sized coffee Arrived. Good so far.Then out came the food. The mushroom soup was thick and tasty, with a slice of bread - OK here a nice chunk of bread would have been nice rather than a slice. The toast was an open sandwich on thickly sliced bloomer, overloaded with ham cheese and huge slices of tomato, accompanied with side salad.We didn't opt for fish and chips, or lasagne, or any of the other great - home cooked main meals because we were eating later, but we could see other people had and they looked as generous and scrumptious as out light bites.The staff were really pleasant, friendly, courteous, efficient and attentive.At the very end of Drury Lane we were luck to find this pub and I mean REALLY LUCKY! It is to be recommended. When next we are in the areas we will most certainly eat there - properly. AND there are good alternatives for vegetarians too, so full marks to you. We look forward to visiting you again. Keep up the good work guys. You are definitely worth seeking out!"
Been using this restaurant for many years and always have a lovely evening with my friends. Food always a high standard. Very well cooked and great choice. The service is very attentive and friendly. The themed nights are great fun - great singers and live music. Ask to sit downstairs if you prefer to be nearer to the live music and want to have a dance. Our favourite local restaurant.
"I deliberately describe this as "" typically French""..the owner is often temperamental .. But the food is consistently above average. Yes the staff keep changing but it's like any normal French neighbourhood restaurant .. Good "" no fuss food"" well presented sometimes with attitude .. Tonight I had a good fillet and an excellent light Pinot Noir..a good night in a good setting ..I recommend ..but remember this is a typical French neighbourhood restaurant ..enjoy it for what it is.."
Nice range of seemingly freshly made food and tasty drinks at reasonable prices for the area. Staff were friendly and helpful. The only weird thing was being asked if we wre going to eat our food on the premises because if you say yes they charge you more for it! Just say no then take it outside if it's a nice day. Will certainly use them again.
My husband and I went for a meal at Rules as a special treat as I had been having chemotherapy which left me unable to enjoy food but was delighted to have my taste buds back!!We travelled from South Wales and made a weekend of it which was amazing.It was an excellent meal with exceptional service by pleasant staff.I have since returned with our two daughters as I wanted them to enjoy the same experience and they were as delighted as we were.
"We spent a lovely evening at 28'50' Fetter lane. We've already been to other restaurant's branches at Maddox and Marylebone and it was awesome dinner we had indeed, but we were quite impressed by experiencing a lovely evening at Fetter Lane! When we got to the restaurant we were welcomed by a waiter in an instant and taken to our table.We weren't very pleased with the table we were offered so we asked if we could change it and we were told it was not a problem at all. So we were offered a quiet table in the back of restaurant. Our coats were taken just before we were seated which was very careful. We were offered water and bread with butter to start the dinner with which was very attentive from the staff. Then after couple of minutes reading through the menu we were told about the limits they had that night. Perhaps in 5-10 minutes later the order was taken by smiling a friendly staff. We ordered lovely board with smoked salmon gravlax and amazing cornish crab as starter! We also chose mains following our starters! The friend of mine was not very sure about what to choose, but the waiter was very well known about the menu so he gave him a recommendation of Duck breast being served pink with polenta and and lovely girolles! I was, on the other hand, quite determined about the main course and I chose a lovely piece of Rib Eye steak about 350 grams. After taking our order, we were questioned if we would like some wine with our food, so we asked for an advise. We were offered lovely carafe of Italian Grechetto which was definitely matching our starters and two glasses of Malbec with our main courses!! It was delicious!! At the moment we finished our mains the dessert menus were put on our table and after couple of minutes the order was taken as well! We took tasty Pear Belle Helene with chocolate sauce and chocolate delice with ice cream! We tried to play tricky guests so we asked waiter about the chocolate sauce. Unfortunately, we failed since we were told the chocolate sauce was made of 66% Valrhona chocolate. The glass of Quarts de Chaume was offered to us as a perfect choice for our dessert which indeed it was!! We were very pleased by the food and amazed by efficient, friendly and nicely talkative service! Despite the fact the restaurant was quite full and there were only two of waiters I suppose the staff remained efficient, professional and friendly!! The one with no waist coat but black apron wearing only had taken care of us for whole evening! We thank you 28'50' for wonderful evening spent there!"
"Went here as I heard about it on facebook as the place that servces Ostrich eggs for breakfast. I went in the evening, so it was a bit late for that... But still fantastic. I honestly think the lamb shank I had was probably the best lamb ive had, and the girlfriend seemed to enjoy her potato and aubergine thing (though my lamb was definitely better, you could see it in her eyes). We also had a bottle of wine, and two very good cocktails - I think mine was called Mr Lambeth, it was a mix of Makers Mark Whiskey, Aperol and Cinzano, and it was again very good. Best of all it is very reasonably priced, 2 meals, 2 cocktails, a bottle of wine and service charge all about £70. Highly recommened, and I intend to return to try the Ostrich egg breakfast at some point. Oh and it's within sight of Lambeth North Station, so location is grand too."
We ate here each morning for four days. Good coffee and yummy porridge! A great way to start the day without spending a fortune!
"All of the food is created and cooked in the way that will help to make you feel good. And, on top of all that, it tastes very good too. It's a small little place and I think it would be a good idea to reserve a table some nights, also they've changed their opening hours a little, so it's worth a call to check.Quite a bit of choice, some of it not so easy to figure out, but the staff will try to explain. The food is good, but not too much of it, and it tastes fresh and clean. It is expensive, without a doubt, but these are London prices and it is in the centre of King's Cross. If you're in the need for good, hot, tasty food, stop in here. The fact that it's vegan is beside the point because it's good food. Full stop. The fact that it's vegan is simply a bonus!"
"This is a little gem, a totally unassuming little bar, close to Smithfield Market. I Arrived in time for happy hour, 2 cocktails for a mere £7 is not to be sniffed at in central London these days! There are also offers on bottle wine and beers. I can vouch for the daiquiris, dark n stormys and white Russians!We had tickets to the movie screening in the upstairs bar. It was a fabulous film, and our hot dogs (real sausages thank god!) and a bowl of popcorn each were served at the start. We opted to have our cocktails post-film, outside. All this is included in the ticket price. We were sat at our own candle-lit table, lots of space and a good view. It's not posh or fancy, but it is comfortable, and the staff clearly care and are helpful, warm and welcoming. I would certainly make a return visit. We really enjoyed ourselves."
"I'm a old lady. And I was so happy and surprised to see a face I recognised from Self ridges. The Manager Jamalia recognised me. It was magic. I came with my grandchild the food was perfect. The service excellent. And the top is to see Jamalia the same, smiling, attentive and a huge heart. I will come back because I know she's there."
"Really like the food here - and it's a cosy place inside too - at least in the bar area. A kind of place I really want to work.But, having been there three times, the think the badly need to improve: service. On our last visit two of the waitresses managed to spend the whole time trying hard to avoid eye contact - necessitating at 3 trips to the bar ourselves to get drinks/menus etc.If that was sorted this would be a 5 star review!"
"my husband and I stopped in for lunch today shortly after Union Jacks opened, we both got pizza and beer and both loved our meals. Service was great, location is amazing, definitely recommend it!"
"Brilliant historic restaurant in the heart of Mayfair. It is very easy for places like this to be very pretentious but that is one thing Quaglinos is not. From the door staff to the front desk and servers the service is excellent and very welcoming. The food and cocktails are both outstanding but (be warned!) the price tag represents this. Lovely restaurant for a special occasion, I will be returning."
"Three of us dined here and all felt that either of the set menus offered enough choice for us without looking down the long list of a la carte options. Each set menu was good value and when the food came, there was plenty of it. It was delicious throughout and all of us said we'd be happy to come back.The service was a bit hit and miss but what was really annoying was that the 'optional' service charge had been added to the bill. We'd have paid it anyway but it wasn't really optional."
"A friend of mine very sweetly organised for around 20 of us to meet at the Roundhouse for Easter lunch this year. It's a great pub, nicely done out inside, clean and well maintained. The staff were very attentive and were handing out Easter bags to the kids containing chocolate eggs and a few little games to keep them amused etc which was a really appreciated nice touch. The menu read very well and there was all the usual English pub grub on offer. However when it Arrived, we were all disappointed with what we were served. Those who ordered the Sunday lunch found the veg in stingy portions, and the lamb was difficult to identify from the beef. One guest ordered the veggie option but it was so incredibly spicy it was inedible and went back to the kitchen. They were hugely apologetic and it wasn't billed, but there wasn't much else on the menu to choose from and everyone else was well into their main course. All in all the service was faultless, welcoming and attentive. Not sure what was going on in the kitchen that day and perhaps they were struggling with a large group all needing service at the same time, but we wouldn't choose this venue for food again."
"Very busy, but no rush to move me on. Not a place for priveate conversations. Friendly, attentive staff. Interesting choice of British twists on favourite food - the fish and chips looked great. My Cumberland sausage , onion and cheese pizza was delicious. As expensive as you want to make it."
"Lovely shabby chique decor and details - totally relaxed atmosphere. Staff are people who truly understand customer service, with a great ""Can Do"" attitude to any request.Party menu is great and covers all tastes, preferences and foibles and the quality is fab and the quantity abundant. Great wine list too. Everything added up to a great evening!"
"Recently had dinner at this delicious French restaurant on a lovely leafy street in stylish Kensington. Excellent personalized service, and each guest is warmly welcomed by Patrick himself. Wonderful very fresh shrimp ""right off the boat"" for a starter, followed by tender lamb chops perfectly cooked in a tasty sauce. Great choice of ckassic wines and Champagne. The crÌ¬me brÌÈlee was fantastic! Cozy atmosphere combining top service with elegant French charm. Bon appetit!"
"Very nice restaurant in the heart of London. Excellent menu and service. Lots of shops around it, you can walk after your meal and enjoy the area."
"Disappointing table by the door but the atmosphere, friendly service and good (not excellent) food made up for it just. Excellent tempura prawns, crispy chicken good and all the sushi were tasty and quickly served as we ordered bit by bit. Good cocktails too."
"They weren't open on Sunday night, to my sorrow, but I made a point of returning a few nights later. I ordered from the take-away counter and ate at the pub across the street (which has sign outside encouraging patrons to do so). It wasn't till I was seated at a sidewalk table with a pint that I noticed there was a restaurant as well. Nevertheless, I was happy with my sole, mushy peas, and a generous portion of chips, and it was nice to be able to dine outdoors in late September. There was a wait of 15 minutes or so for the take-away but the food was well worth it."
"Called in here after a family celebration.Atmosphere was great, service was superb but although the food was served quickly and far more than we could ever eat it was soooo spicy.Completely spoiled the dinner.Between 4 of us we had the 2 set £28 menus but every dish was completely over powered by hot chillies and a large dusting of chilly powder.Thought Thai was all about subtle flavours.Sorry but wouldn't recommend."
"Superb food, superb wine, superb service, superb staff- consummate professionals ! A truly memorable and delicious Birthday dinner. We cannot more highly recommend this wonderful restaurant and are looking forward to returning soon ."
Great staff combined with great food makes it one of the best I ever been. Norbert and Victor u guys been amazing. Keep it up. I will be regular there.
"The food itself is very average, the chicken on all of our dishes was overlooked, slightly burnt. The staff were lovely and the building itself was beautiful. Very good location on the docks.Overall it's the food which lets Strada down."
"Got to restaurant early about 11.30 am as it was new year eve. Place empty. Ordered meal, service was good."
Excellent proportion sizes and prices with very friendly staff... Loved the atmosphere as it is very nice and cosy. I would definitely go again.
It was perhaps a bit pricey to eat in rather than take away but the staff were incredible. So friendly and attentive and the food was superb. The meat cooked to perfection. They include complimentary bread and mini baklava at the end. Would recommend.
"Just round the corner from the Hoxton Hotel where I was staying is this pub with restaurant up stairs. Small but excellently prepared menu, relaxed but attentive service. Quite small -we went during the week but you may be best to book at the weekends."
Am a bit late with this review as we went mid-May but didn't want our experience to slip by unrecorded. It's so easy just to put negative experiences down without 'accentuating the positive' as the song goes! ....I had taken a friend here in homage to an elderly aunt who had passed away and who liked a drink if I can downplay her condition a little ;-). A champagne afternoon tea seemed a fitting tribute although we were a little nervous when we Arrived to find ourselves alone in the large dining room. Probably why they now limit their teas to Fridays and weekends. However we were offered a champagne cocktail to start with which hadn't been on the 'star deal'we'd booked but we were happy to accept! When the tea came it looked delicious and so it proved and every time our glasses were empty they were re filled. After about 3 refills I opted to abstain but was pressed to 'just half a glass maybe' by the charming waiter. So certainly no stingyness here! All in all a delightful experience and certainly a place I will revisit without waiting for a specific reason again!
"We were shopping on Oxford Street and we're looking for somewhere to eat. Walking by we saw this Bella Italia (We eaten at others and love their food) and thought it would be ideal. We went in, the manager came up to us and we asked if they had a table for 3. He said they do but food is about 30 mins from ordering. That wasn't a problem. However this is where the problems started. He took us round the corner and pointed to a table at the far end and said you can sit there. He didn't take us to our seats, he just pointed to them, so we made our way there. We ordered a starter. I had meatballs, and my partner and step daughter had a garlic pizza to share. My meatballs were hot but the pizza was over cooked and stone cold. They did replace but it didn't come until after I had finished mine. The mains came whilst they were literally chewing the last of their starters. Low and behold my pizza was also stone cold and the daughters carbonara had no bacon. She chose to eat it though as luckily she did ask to have some chicken in it. They'd pretty much finished their mains by the time my pizza had Arrived. Whilst still eating my pizza, the waitress asked the girls in they would like the dessert menu????? Come the bill time they had voluntarily taken the price off the starter and main but that wasn't the point. It put a real downer on the end of what was a fantastic weekend for our daughters 21st birthday. All I can say is avoid the place at all costs."
Myself and a few friends went for dinner and some drinks. It was a busy nightGreat service. Very attentive and quick. Waiters had a great attitude with smiles all round. Knowledgable on the menu and happy to answer any questions. First time here and would definitely go again
"Were meeting friends for a Friday night diner and this was our first visit so didn't know what to expect. The restaurant is literally two minutes walk from Embankment station next to the pier. Entry to the restaurant is via a gangplank and not sure if accessible to all with steps up to the Upper Deck restaurant. Found it difficult to get the attention of the bar staff as to where we were sitting. I was surprised as to how few dining tables there were which primarily occupied one side with the other side with tables for drinkers. The table was well laid and everything was clean. Staff attending the dining tables were polite but difficult to get their attention for ordering. The food was very tasty and served hot and the wine was good too. Would recommend the smoked Mackerel mousse starter and the roast Halibut, both of which were delicious. Ordered the cheese which was ok but only served with 6 tiny biscuits.The atmosphere was quite noisy but I put that down to a large birthday diner being held and also a group of loud males sitting at the adjoining drinking table (to be fair they were eventually asked to leave as disturbing others). All in all a pleasant evening with the cost working out just over £55 a head. My main observation is that its a shame that the restaurant could not be just for diners as there are other parts of the boat used for just drinkers. I think we would return as close to station and convenient meeting place for friends."
"Looks like this place has gone under some refurbishment as the restaurant section of the shop seems to have completely vanished. Take-Away only now? with a few tables and chairs scatted outside?My first (and probably last) visit proved disappointing. I ordered a large Cod and large chips which came to £10.50 which even by London standards is somewhat expensive for take-away C&C.Positives:Cod was cooked well and quite tastyStaff were polite and efficientService was fast (considering fish was cooked to order)Negatives:Chips were awful. Dry, overcooked and tastelessExpensive but I guess if you're a tourist it's ok to check it out. There are cheaper alternatives of Fish&Chips in London if you are willing to explore."
"Good and fresh daily made food. very central, good service, shouldnt charge to eat in though..................................................................."
Went for friend birthday didn't wait long for a table drinks were very tasty wine was of great quality. Servers Pedro and gampiero were very friendly polite and professional made our evening all the more enjoyable. Food was seriously good have never had a steak like it. Food was served quickly and the starters and dessert were also brilliant over all we will be going again soon it was a great night and a great atmosphere as well !!! Thank you!
Our first visit to a Jamie Oliver restaurant and on the whole really enjoyed it. We Arrived at 8pm on a Tuesday and were seated straight away.The four of us had starters which were excellent and then each had a different Pizza and shared them. I had a piece which blew my head off and found out it there was a scotch bonnet in it. The service was very good and thought the bill was reasonable as we had starters/mains and desserts with 2 bottles of wine which came to £135. Overall a great experience and would go back again.
"We had a pre-theatre dinner here before a concert at the Royal Albert Hall, thanks to an online offer, which offered us a 4-course meal plus a cocktail for less than £60 for 2 people. The food was all exquisite, and we were made to feel really special, with no hint of us being second-class citizens on our special offer. The staff were also really aware that we needed to get to the Albert Hall by 7.30 and ensured that the food came in good time. As we were paying, the waitress gave us a voucher for another special offer, which we will definite take up next time we are in London."
Old fashioned pub which feels dated rather than quaint. Popular for drinks outside in a sunny day but don't eat here. Food is clearly cooked from frozen and is very poor quality.
"I was really impressed by the two waiters who were serving us at our company social recently. They were both polite and attentive, making the experience more enjoyable for everyone!Thank you!"
"Went in on a Sunday, lovely sunny day, bar was 4 deep and only 4 staff on eventually got a drink and paid for food this was at 15.25,no warning that the food orders would take sometime to appear so i presumed all was okay, I had to leave at 16.30 to go to work at 16.00 I approached the rather busy waitress who at first couldnt find my order in the huge pileof slips, she then informed me that my Nachos would be at least another hour and a half in coming, a trip to the bar to reclaim my money took 15 mins.Why do the bar staff not inform customers that the waiting time for food may be long, giveing you the option to decline. I watched this place lose customer after customer when they walked in and seen the queue at the bar,sorry but the sunny weather was predicted, you are by the river with lovely views and management didnt think that perhaps a few extra staff might be a good idea?wont be back, even although the place i stay in is 2 mins away."
"We went to Chit Chaat Chai on Friday for dinner and the food, service, staff, cocktails, and atmosphere were all fantastic, can't wait for my next visit."
"This Jaime Oliver restaurant is right in the middle of Covent Garden's main area, under cover but with glass walls all the way around. You need to arrive early for lunch or dinner to avoid the long lines of people waiting to get in. The food is great and the staff are very welcoming. Its quick and easy and fun. Seats and legs are kept warm with heating."
"If you've been to a TGI before you know what to expect. If not - it's loud, busy and the food is generically American. The servers are supposed to be over the top and excitable but that doesn't translate too well in London. The service was average, the food was adequate. The childrens food was mini versions of adult food - bit too over the top for a child's basic pallet - most of the additions were picked/ scraped out the burger. As it was the olympics the children had to answer some questions about sport to get a free ice team and there was a good colouring pack for them."
"Party of two went for early dinner. Restaurant was energetic, the food was tasty, and the service attentive. Definitely a place to go. Try the specials - they are always worth the stop. I will go again this week."
"There are so many places to eat that in London we are spoilt for choice. Kobe Sushi have really good authentic Japanese food that is better than superb. The service is excellent and we eat here regularly now. The restaurant is very efficient, very well maintained and very very clean. Staff regularly wiped down and reset tables as soon as customers left even when super busy!! Well done - the prices are a little higher than some places but you get what you pay for, quality food and quality service."
"The service has gone down massively in the past 6 months or so. We were frequent diners at this restaurant and yesterday we went for lunch. Our waitress continuously scowled at us and looked annoyed every time we asked her a question, the plates were filthy and instead of bringing me another, I saw the waiter polishing it behind the counter! We were continuously ignored as we flagged the waitresses down and so we complained to the manager. She came over with the annoyed waitress, who moved towards me as though she may hit me and the manager had to hold her back!! Unbelievable! We told them to cancel our mains as we had enough, and although she apologised, we were faced with the bill for the full amount, which shocked us. Had we received some kind of discount, or complimentary drinks by way of apology, we would have thought about returning, but this is completely unacceptable! We're all pleased to see there is a Rosa's Thai opening a couple of doors down, we won't be going back to this branch of Dim T!"
"Recently celebrated a 50th birthday with 15 in the upstairs priveate room. Food could not have been better, or better served. Yes, it feels old and stodgy, but then again it is 'English' AND the oldest restaurant in London. Have the beef wellington...to die for, and finish with some port and cheese. A place not to be missed!"
"Located in almost every neighborhood, Pret is the place of choice when eating on the run. Prices are reasonably and food is good."
Finally a good old italian coffee served by italians with a smile!!Their small cheese selection is very good for pecorino amateurs but quite pricey!!
"We dined at The Green Pea last Friday and had the most wonderful pies with the best ever gravy, creamiest mashed potato and dishes of fresh vegetables. Tom was as we expected a real character the only down side is we didn't realise there isn't a wine list and would have brought a bottle with us as Tom is quite happy for patrons to do this. Our son had the Guiness which he said was the best he ever tasted quite different from the usual pub stuff. In fact it's making me quite hungry just remembering it! Do go if you enjoy well cooked homely food but not if you are in a hurry as service is very relaxed!!"
"Had a great evening at Hispaniola. The view of the london eye was great from our table. The staff were very friendly and helpful throughout our visit, the food was very good and did not have to wait long between courses either. The very slight rocking of the boat and the piano player made this a very unique experience and will definitely be going back soon!"
"ive been to Tootoomoo on four or five occasions now and I have thoroughly enjoyed it every time. The food is extremely tasty and I love the fact that they are constantly adding new things to the menu while retaining old favourites. In particular I would strongly recommend the chicken rendang and the black cod but my favourite has to be the crab tempura starter; it's incredibly addictive. They also do gorgeous cocktails, which slip down very easily! The service has been very welcoming every time ive been and I find it great value for money. I look forward to getting take out from the restaurant very soon"
"Been here several times, the ambience is good, the food has been consistently tasty and the service is also very good. Great place for a quick lunch or relaxed dinner."
"I rate Byron's for a quick and tasty lunch. That's all changed since I tried Honest.Full marks here.Top end beef, friendly service and fast, delicious burger and fries (and no extra charge for the fries).Fantastic."
"We visited London for one day and night. Saturday was busy with visiting the West End, seeing a show at the Menier Chocolate Factory and thenice skating at the Tower. So we were looking forward to sitting down for a pleasant dinner, and were not dissapointed.We'd Arrived earlier than booked, but the waitress was happy to seat us immediately with no bother.The Maitre D' was very attentive and proffesional, as were all the staff.The food was lovely and the atmosphere was relaxed. The restaurant is very well decorated.We'd return readily."
"The Indigo restaurant is on the mezzanine floor of Number One, The Alwych, in an elegant, modern room with orange/ochre upholstered dining chairs, tables with attractive white cloths (two per table laid in cruciform), and stylish arched windows. It's ideal for pre- or post-theatre, with a set menu at around £25. We went there again to recapture our previous enjoyment. It was good, but had gone slightly off the boil. The set menuthis time was pork belly, quiche or some other vegetarian dish, so we went for the a la carte, sipping our drinks as one of our guests waited an age for her Gin and Tonic, which had to be rustled up from the bar. Celeriac soup was tasty, but seemed to have been thickened with flour; salmon and halibut main courses were fresh, delicious and well presented, though it seemed that the excellent bowl of baked, crusted mashed potatoes with lobster pieces had been pre-cooked and reheated in the microwave. A slight disappointment was the wonderful sounding dessert for two, a plate of five pairs of mini-desserts based on a chocolate and beetroot theme: a wonderful idea, a tour de force in production values, but a little bit stodgy in parts and too much gelatine in the gateau. Tea and coffee ordered at the same time with a request that they came with the dessert did not emerge until ten minutes later, after a bit of pressing. It was good that we sat down an hour and a half before we had to leave for the theatre. Food came out at a reasonable £32.50 per head plus drinks and 12.5% service. It's still a very agreeable restaurant, but could be a touch sharper."
I live locally and haven't been here for over 10 years. I thought I would pop in on a sunny weekend. The service was slow and it took quite a while for our order to be taken. We only ordered a main course each. It was awful pasta and the meatballs were really poor. It was not high quality meat. The whole experience was below average. There are so many other places on the Northcote Road to try and so to have repeat customers you really have to improve your offering. It looks so lovely from the outside so it was a shame to have such a poor experience.
"Popped in here from the Travelodge across the road for lunch & wasn't disappointed. A relaxed place with an eclectic mix of clientele. I loved the Blue Moon american craft IPA that they served on draft even though I'm not a great beer drinker. My friend had the fish & chips which were a good sized portion & tasty tho' the fish was a bit over cooked. I had chicken pancetta & leek pie which was excellent, with mash & veggies. The 'pie' was a large piece of light puff pasty on top of the dish not strictly a pie but still very tasty. All served by friendly efficient staff. The surroundings are a bit passed there best but there is the history of being the oldest licensed premises since 1216 with Dick Turpin listed as one of its earlier customers."
"Would recommend this restaurant to anyone, food and wine delicious. A small but select menu, the sauces are superb. Great atmosphere, my friend was celebrating her birthday and Patrick had the whole restaurant sing happy birthday. A really special night."
"I celebrated my wedding anniversary with my husband on a cold and very wet February Sunday having had a trip up the Shard. After battling with the elements as soon as we set foot in the Gaucho we were transported into Nirvana. Attentive and very friendly staff ensured we were seated comfortably enquiring about our disappointing viewing experience in London's tallest building due to the dismal weather. As compensation our waiter went out of his way to move our table so we were in line with Tower Bridge much to our surprise and delight!We started our anniversary meal with exquisite cocktails then had the most delicious steak I have ever tasted. This really is the place to go for steak!Fine wine, scrumptious dessert and a consistently high standard of service meant we were well and truly spoilt. Finally we were brought complimentary champagne to celebrate our anniversary. Gaucho, and particularly the waiters who served us, thank you for making our anniversary special. x"
You can smell the fish & chips outside the shop and tastes yummy! Reasonable value and good chunky chip shop chips
"Excellent restaurant that is run by a Korean family. Has a long menu of Japanese items and a section of Korean food which we chose from. Absolutely delicious, 10/10 service and some interesting dishes."
The food here was tasty but I have to say I wouldn't be coming back anytime soon as quite expensive for what it is. The pecan pie pudding we had was very dry so wouldn't have that again. I liked the place because it had a good atmosphere and was nice to see friends there and have a nice evening but I think it was a bit overpriced for what it was.
"The area around the Blackfriar Station is an old towne London village. Great food for breakfast and brunch. The little back streets have shops where you can find handmade crumpets, go to a ""somewhat"" high tea, and pick up some great grub food."
"We enjoyed Sunday lunch at the Park Terrace Restaurant. We cannot fault it, the food was excellent and the service attentive without being overwhelming. We were particularly impressed with the chef providing gluten free bread for one of our party. We will certainly return on our next visit to London."
Delicious ready made food. Makes worth it's name. Everything is delicious and not time consuming. Everything is natural and organic. Recommended
"Breakfasts here were a treat. The food was fresh and beautifully presented. The staff were friendly, efficient and engaging. It had a busy bubbling atmosphere. Relatively small table areas and good takeaway service."
"Loved it! Amazing food, great service, attentive staff. It is quite pricey but well worth it for a special treat. Would definitely go back."
"Is my favourite italian restaurant at all in London. Situated 10 minutes away from Putney Bridge. The food is amazing with a good service and staff really friendly. Everytime Im going there I can taste Puglia food. Always going there with friends and family and always they want to go back. I raccomanded also the small ""La Pizzica"" which is only 5 minutes away from ""La pizzica Restaurant"". they served as well good food and a lot of take away choose!!!!"
had early dinner here and without question this is worse Thai experience any whereThe rice was so gongealed it was inedible. We are not fussy eaters but the rest of the food was indescribable and to add insult plus £106 for two - Avoid at all costs
"We are here with friends and we each had a baby in tow. The restaurant and staff were very accommodating. We had the set menu which was great, the food was excellent! I would definitely go back again."
"Wow wow and wow again, firstly the views, well London lit up at night, is the most beautiful city in the world, and the views looking out from this gorgeous restaurant high up in the sky were more than spectacular. The food was absolutely first class and my starter of fruits of the sea linguine was one of the most amazing dishes I have ever eaten. And my Irish short rib main was not only melt in the mouth diveine, but also beautifully presented. My apricot parfait dessert with peaches, almond granola, and toasted almond ice cream was just an explosion of deliciousness. All washed down with not one but two Bright Spark cocktails, probably one of the best cocktails ive ever had. I can't say what everyone else had in our part of four, or I will give away the whole menu!!! I will say that the portions were not massive, however I did not go home hungry. Service was also excellent. As it was a belated birthday treat for 3 of us, they sent us home with 3 cakes, which was such a nice touch.It was very expensive (in fact eye watering expensive), but the food, the decor, the service, and the spectacular views made it an experience I would definitely want to repeat. Loved it."
Looking for a quick bite before going to the winter wonderland in Hyde Park. Found this place en route. 5 adults and 5 children to feed. They had a special kids menu. £5.95 for normal burger chips and a milk shake. Good value and very tasty. I got the hardcore burger- 6oz burger with lobster and all the trimmings. Perfectly cooked and delicious. Nice assortment of sauces ala nandos to pick from. All in all a nice surprise. Oh we paid £140 for all of us.
"These are a dependable stop for a pit stop lunch or snack. They are all over London so there is comfort in knowning that good, fresh food is readably available when out and about. I have eaten at several and they are very consistant. Pret is a dependable friend when grabbing a bite in London. I never hesitate to drop in."
"Had a quick business lunch and was pleased with the quality.Haggis pops for starters which were good.However standout for me was the venison and chips. If the ingredients aren't excellent then it'll be a disappointment as there ls no where to hide. No problem here, great cooking and very satisfying flavour.Will be giveing this place another go.Service friendly."
"Although I regret the relaxation of dress standards (surely Rules .... of all restaurants.... would have no difficulty attracting enough people even if they still insisted on a tie for gentlemen and no jean or shorts...?!), this is as you may know the classiest, and oldest London restaurant there is. I went there with my wife and daughter for our last night in England and loved it. Just breathe in the history and the service. Special mention to the charming, top notch man on the door who greeted us and got us the cab."
"A unique place in a world of chain pubs. What's cool is they have regular fun events, like poetry slams, movie nights and jazz concerts. I got a groupon for jazz night recently and the staff were just incredible. I was shown to my seat and had my order taken in no time. The band was great and the food really hit the spot. I always prefer priveately owned spots because they tend to have more character and atmosphere about them, don't you agree?"
"Wonderful selection of all kinds of breakfast items for all kinds of world tastes. Best we had comparing with the buffets in Paris, Florence and Rome."
"Had lunch here today, the lager was pleasant enough while we waited for our food.I had the UJ burger, I watched as the chefs prepared it, then watched as it sat on the pass under the heat lamps which weren't on, the pizza was bought round to the pass from another kitchen area and I could see the steam rising off from it, this too sat on the pass for ages...When we got our meals the burger was lukewarm and the pizza cold. Add this to plates with chips out of the sides, condiments that were damaged and a novelty ketchup bottle without a top on covered in old sticky ketchup....not the best...The pud on the other hand was good, apple crumble cheesecake was very nice and the cheeseboard seemed to go down well.The coffee is very ordinary and ours was also served cold...At £55 for two I think this should be a lot better, I won't be rushing back."
We loved this place! The staff were so helpful with the older members of the group and those with dietary restrictions. Food was delicious but simple.
We ate here on a saturday evening and lucky to get a table. Food was of decent quality - i had the seafood pasta which was nice - although we had garlic bread to start with mozzarella - there wasn't much of a taste of garlic. Reasonable priced red wine too/.
"We didn't know what we wanted to eat after quite a heavy NYE dinner, but the review interested us and we decided to give it a try...How good of a try it was! The Meat Menu is EXACTLY what you want: a perfect combination of starters and dippings with pita bread and perfectly grilled meat with a good choice between chicken, lamb and keftedes (too bad there were only 2 of them, I could have eaten a whole bunch of them, they were soooo good !). But a good dinner is not as enjoyable without a good atmosphere and staff, and there again Santorini does it well: very friendly, service-efficient and welcoming. The best testimony of Santorini's quality is the number of regular customers who were around. We will come back !"
Four of us enjoyed sharing a selection of delicious smaller plates before embarking on a huge rib of beef beautifully and perfectly cooked and served. Quite frankly it was all faultless!
"We had a great evening meal at Reform Social, the staff were attentive and the restaurant had a good vibe about it. Starters were really tasty, well above expectations. Then we both had steak for mains and that was great too, the only minor negative was the onion rings in cider batter were a bit tasteless. All in all, good food and great service in a nice venue, I would certainly return."
"The food is always very good and well-presented at CÌ«te restaurants, and this one is no exception, whilst the prices are lower than many chain competitors. This outlet is convenient for the West End theatres but service can slow significantly after 6pm."
"A smile to greet us would've been a good start but no just ""a look"" was given. Having travelled Asia I get increasingly annoyed at how these commercial chains think they are serving us the proper taste of Asia.. In all the food was pretty tasteless and were forgotten by our ""look"" waitress and was left there to wonder when our mains would arrive.. Thankfully the blonde polish waitress knows what she's doing..in all a huge disappointment."
"A nice place to go for a drink - lovely views across the river, and being on a bar that's also a boat feels like a bit of a novelty. But be aware that at low tide the gangplank onto the boat gets a pretty severe gradient that might affect your ability to get on and off the boat if you have mobility issues (or even if you are just wearing unsensible shoes!!!)"
"Having read previous reviews, I cannot believe that my wife and I spent an enjoyable hour in the same Union Jacks in Covent Garden. Admittedly we only had drinks but the atmosphere was relaxed and easy going, our server, Jamie, was attentive with a fantastic personality. The British Wine we drank was awesome and the cost was very competitive. We will certainly return."
We've eaten here twice and can't rate it enough. Pre-dinner cocktails are something else. The surroundings are lovely and really atmospehric. The staff really do look after you and make you feel special.The food is delicious and must recommend the cheese and biscuits with port - fantastic.
We decided to have a drink their after a visit to The Emirates Stadium. We had hot drink but the staff were very helpful and friendly in my life with excellent services.
"As my wife and i are big 'The Apprentice' fans we were determined to visit this cafe. This cafe is extremely easy to find close to West Acton tube station, we couldn't believe our luck when we found this cafe. We knew what the cafe looked like from the outside from the TV programme, but we were a bit weary about the food. We were warmly welcomed by the owner and we decided to order one big breakfast with a change of extras including another egg and baked beans. My wife ordered bubble and squeak which looked great. We were expecting to wait at least half an hour for the food to arrive however within 5 minutes we wee tucking into our meals.The food tasted delicious and was soon eaten all up.The atmosphere was great and the owners were superb. With our meals, 2 cups of coffee and 2 bottles of coke for later our total was £13.00. Highly recommend this cafe, wished we lived closer so we could visit daily. Please be aware the cafe is not on the road stated on this website. It is on alliance road, just off saxon drive."
"Eight of us had booked at the Yak & Yati for a Saturday evening just after Christmas. The service was excellent - we were given a round table at the rear of this largish restaurant. The table was ideal for chatting with everyone. The cuisine is basically Indian. We had varieties of starters : chicken, mutton, venison and veg. dishes. They were all delicately spiced and well cooked.The starters were quite filling and we did not order as much of the mains the Dhall made with ""zimbu"" we were informed that this was a Tibetian spice and used in a lot of North Indian Cuisine. The Zimbu Dhall was very good.Overall a good night out"
"I personally love this place. I can not eat gluten and the menu doesn't really cater much for us, however I still love the atmosphere of the place, so I still go with my friends whenever I am in Hammersmith. Also every night they have a different cuisine menu and on a Wednesday they had Indian that was all gluten free which was great, and above all, its not expensive."
"I visit this place quite regularly when shopping in Wandsworth and it never fails to deliver. I have gone through most of the dishes on the menu and im always satisfied. The portions are big and the prices are very affordable considering this is London. If you go shopping in the Southside or go out for a movie, you have to try this little gem of a restaurant."
"We were attending a concert at the Royal Albert and wanted to eat first. It is an easy walk to the hall. We could not book for the restaurant at the hotel as it was already fully booked for the next night. The friendly young man on the desk suggested we went into the bar and book for tapas. The atmosphere in there is old worldly and very charming.The food is very nice although a little pricey. We had one disappointment in the servic though, we ordered one tapas but got another similar one that had cheese....we did not ask for this one. When we said this was not the one we ordered the waitress said it was almost the same. Ha ha I wanted the broad beans not the mozzarella cheese. I really thought they would apologise and change it, but no, they watched us pick through the other ingredients without a word. We spent over £100 so of course they encouraged us to come back after the concert. We had a nasty taste with this experience so didn't go back, which was a shame as it could have been fun. They put on a good show of fine service but when it actually comes to real service it is lacking."
"Great food, Jamie Oliver style. Proper English grub in a trendy atmosphere, inside but open air with heated seats and heaters above, it's quirky, fairly priced and smack bang in the middle of Covent Garden. We've been a fair few times now, I'd recommend the fish and chips, crackin!!!"
"Went there because of the Time Out review that called it cheap and cheerful and very good. Was hugely disappointed!The service was chaotic; at one point we had 3 starters and 1 main (all came at different times) and still no drinks. The summer rolls were tasteless and banal. The noodles were ok but you can just go to Wagamama for that. The Pho was decent. We asked for the traditional Vietnamese coffee (on the menu) but were told they were 'too busy' to do it that evening. We're talking about a coffee that drips itself under gravity. It literally pours itself over some condensed milk, in front of you. Are you serious?!To top it up we were asked to leave as apparently my sister was taking too long to finish her scorching hot tea. First time that has happened to me; a new low, even for London standards.In short: not that cheap, zero cheerfulness, don't bother. AVOID!"
"We don't usually do chains. However, PE now have a great gluten free offering and my wife is celiac, so always looking for good options. Menu for both celiacs and non is good, a few interesting Xmas touches (berry crumble is outstanding). But the service from the team there was brilliant.They helped with our stroller, gave us a toddler friendly table and had pencils and paper on the table by the time we were sat down.They served us quickly and engaged with our 2yo to make her experience fun.Thanks and well done PE team."
"Yet again a sure fire winner ! The lovely thing about Polpo is that although the menu is not enormous you can choose an entirely different type of lunch every time you visit!The dishes are best for sharing and this time we enjoyed frito misto, courgette and rocket salad, pizzette with asparagus and speck and arancini. The food comes when it's ready so don't plan and order to your meal! We also enjoyed the special dessert of a chocolate almond and hazelnut cake.The atmosphere is buzzy and the tables close together so no secrets here!"
"Staff unfriendly, Tables not set up, knives and forks thrown at us after requesting them whilst our food was on the table. Waitress did not know what coleslaw is, they don't actually serve it there. The food was awful. I actually think they cooked the cardboard box the potatoe skins come in by mistake. Meat course steak and ribs dry and overcooked. I believe the Jack Daniels sauce we were served was actually soy sauce. Desert still frozen in the center. No manager on duty spoke later on phone promised vouchers to shut us up. As yet not received anything.As for the toilets.............Advise not to go."
"Having purchased a Travelzoo voucher, my Husband and I had a meal here for our 11th Wedding Anniversary. The staff were very attentive and went out of their way to ensure we enjoyed our meal and time at the restaurant. Our food was very nice and plentiful and at the end we were extremely full. The icing on the cake was that they presented us some lovely celebratory treats. That's what I call going the extra mile to make sure your customers feel special.We were given a voucher at the end of our meal and would definitely love to go back."
"I was bought a three course meal here via groupon for my birthday and I have to say I was very disappointed with the whole evening. My partner is South African so we thought it would take us back to our African roots, firstly the waitress was very pleasant and we ordered our food without any fuss. The starter was nice and although there wasn't much of it you generally expect this from the first course. I ordered spatchcock chicken for my main and my partner had the spit roast of the day which was pork. When it Arrived I was slightly shocked to see a whole baby chicken on my plate! not even butterflied which is what spatchcock chicken is! and that was it! No veg, no potatoes nothing! when I asked where the rest was they said that this is all we get and if we want veg or potatoes etc we have to pay extra!......we were not told this at the time of ordering! My partner's pork was two slices of pork belly with a baked bean sauce, defiantly NOT South African and also nothing else!.... when it came to paying the bill they didn't take the total amount of the groupon voucher off which had already been paid by my brother as they said this includes groupon commission....? We couldn't wait to get out of there as the whole experience was a waste of time. Nice decor but absolutely nothing South African about it!"
"We stayed at the Sheraton Grand Park Lane and had a special opportunity as a Platinum Guest to have both the hot and cold buffets for 5 English pounds each plus gratuity. What a fabulous spread of cheeses, meats, breads, fresh fruit, and....in addition to a eggs the way you want them. We had a terrific breakfast and the service was good."
"Went here for dinner. Very friendly service, good price, and very tasty. Had the Nasi Goreng and the chicken soba noodles. Good serving portions."
"Ambience of this restaurant is a bit dark & gloomy but the staff light up your experience. I liked the food but didn't think it was great. I am a foodie and know a good meal when I have one. The best thing I ate throughtout my meal was the sticky toffee pudding. Best I have had albeit I couldn't finish it - too sweet after you've had half. If you are a sweet tooth, you will fall in love with this dessert and probably want more. Pea and spinach soup - too bland, don't have it."
I ate here everyday that I was in London! They have great food in an awesome grab 'n go concept. My favorite is the lamb wrap!! I wish there was one in California :-(
"Love this place, really good for just popping in with the kids for lunch. The pizzas are great and the staff are really friendly. They have nice outdoor seating. Also a good place to come in the evening with friends. I'm a regular."
"Delicious burgers, great setting, a welcome break from the kitsch of Porto bello market. Be aware of the ordering at the counter"
"We went after a recomendation from a friend thats a local and I would visit again. The place is very hip, the speed of the service, the music, and the people visiting is fairly high so go there for a nice meal and a chat rather than a romatic evening.The food was indeed nice and there was a good selection of meat, fish, vegetarian and dessert. We had:Bruschetta with artichoke and Parma ham - 4/5 for taste and portion size, but the bread was a bit on the doughy sideCroquettes with Parmesan - 3/5 fairly tasteless but so are most croquettesLamb & mint meatballs - 5/5 nice tast of lamb and not too heavy on the mint. Served with mild tomato sauceRoast potatoes with rosemary - 5/5 simple, nice, with a good crustFlank steak - 4/5 nice taste, medium cooked but ours was a bit on the cold side. Served with rocket and a garlic dressingTiramisu - 4/5 great taste but slightly too runnyPannacotta with rhubarb and pistachio - 4/5 pieces of rhubarb and pistachio + candy sugar on a Pannacotta with great creamy texture. Minus for the rhubarb sauce tasting no rhubarb and lots of sugarThe service is quick and one of the reasons might be I counted 12 personnel + kitchen staff, in a restaurant with around 50 seats!"
The restaurant's atmosphere was a bit formal but the food and staff were great. I would definitely recommend it for a quick bite. (During my visit the staff was not slow at all!).
"Hidden away in a small alleyway in the St James area of London, Il Vicolo could easily be missed. However, it is well-known to local business people and residents and is a popular venue for lunch and weekday dinners. The owner Giacomo is a warm and welcoming host and the menu encompasses a good range of fresh Italian cuisine. Wine is excellent, always served at the correct temperature. The atmosphere is intimate and not overstated but sophisticated. It is difficult to 'recommend' something as the dishes are very much seasonal and specials are usually an excellent choice. Prices are very reasonable, given the location, and on many occasions Giacomo has treated us to a complimentary Limoncello. This restaurant is versatile in terms of its clientele - suitable for a romantic evening, business, and family gatherings - and we have been here for a most enjoyable birthday dinner."
The food was lovely combined with the beautiful views and excellent service made for an amazing experience
"It is 20 years since I was last here, so it is a bit of a snapshot. However, I was slightly disappointed. The fois gras terrine was uninspired. The steak and kidney pudding was bland and under seasoned. My home cooked version is much better. However, the ambience, the decor and the service are superb."
"ive read some indifferent reviews of this chain but when your a visitor to London with limited time I found them a great place to eat at a reasonable cost. I like the fact that you can go along the glass cases & choose what appeals. Then take it to the counter to be heated or toasted, & purchase your drink & extras while you wait. It's quick, inexpensive, filling & tasty. And they seem to be everywhere. Also, ive always been treated politely in their shops."
Had breakfast here on my way to a work meeting. Great friendly guys running the place. Order taken quickly and my cooked breakfast Arrived soon after. Good quality ingredients too.
I have been to 2 other restaurants of this chain. Last year May and September 2013. To two different stores and food was very good in both. However on the 5th October 2014 I went with family to have lunch. The pizza was tasteless and dry and cold. I had pasta pomidoro with Basil and non existant garlic. Not the best food and service. I had to ask for parmesan and black pepper I hope they don't lose their Italian taste for flavour. Ill give it one more try when I'm in London again. Bev Moore
"Over the years, consistently good for fish n'chips. My favorite is the plaice. For those who like their fish n'chips in Matza Meal, you can order all year round, not only during Passover. British folklore says that Jews invented fried fish n'chips. Who knows? What is important is that the Sea Shell is consistently good, well located to public transport (near the Marylebone tube station), and reasonably priced, with decent service."
Great food and great service. Had one of the best meals ive had in London for a long time. Thought it was extremely good value for money. All the waiters were extremely attentive.
"Varied Italian menu. Friendly service. Lovely outdoor seating area. Prices are fair.Efficient, friendly service."
because we had such high expectations for this restaurant since it is owned by jamie Oliver. The food was good and fresh-but the portions a bit small and underwhelming.
"This restaurant could be taken out of a Spanish town. Real portions and taste. Of course nothing fancy, for that, go to an Italian restaurant. Real food back to its basics, real portions, good wine, the whole at a normal price!"
"I'd like to give this place four stars, as the Sunday Roast I had was excellent, and my friends' food was too. So, full marks for the dishes. But the service is, well, crap. We had to ask twice for many things, a coffee my friend ordered never turned up, the waitress looked she wanted to be anywhere else but there. Staff - smile more, say hello, how are you etc, remember customers' orders and if something is taking a bit of time, acknowledge it and apologise. Service basics, really."
"Truly, I found a very welcoming friendly staff, food is good, prices are within the range, location was perfect for me after a Long day shopping in Oxford street.nothing I found so special in their menu, but I'll come again"
"I just got back from New York, expecting the food in London to be mediocre BUT this place pleasantly surprised me! I have never been here and we spotted it from afar and decided to go with it! It was SO GOOD! The love that comes from the chef and her husband who also happen to be the owners of the place comes through so much in the dishes! And the staff was amazing honestly! The friendliest most welcoming team in central London! Try the banana cake and the lobster! Beautiful loving and unforgettable!"
"We were warmly welcomed by the lovely staff in which turned out to be a truly fantastic evening. It was Michael Buble tribute night and he was great entertainment. The food was such a surprise though,perfectly cooked fish presented quite beautifully. That goes for all three courses truth be told, even though I'm not sure how I managed the dessert as portion sizes are big. The service was impeccable and I can't wait to return again very soon to what is one of our loveliest local restaurants . I recommend wholeheartedly ... You will not be disappointed."
We were waiting for our daughter and wanted a quick coffee and found this organic food and Greek cafe. They serve good coffee and pastries and service was quick and friendly
"Can't comment on any other dining experience as I only used this place for breakfast.All I can say is abysmal!! Whilst I accepted that this was an extremely busy morning, the standard of food was some of the worst that I have come across.Grey scrambled eggs, dried out and extremely tough bacon, luke warm Tomatoes and beans, a toaster that only toasted one side_ really could go on but is it going to make any difference. I assume not!!One positive... waiting staff are very efficient and attentive!!"
"We booked the bar for a family celebration and it was a great choice. The atmosphere was lovely with lots of places for groups to sit and a big space for the band and ceremony. Staff were fantastic, attentive and helpful and responded to all our requests. Food (buffet) was lovely and tasty and very plentiful. The beers are interesting and the wine list is small but well chosen - the pinot noir very good. Altogether a lovely occasion and many thanks to all for helping make it so memorable."
"We stumbled upon Warda during a recent stay in Southgate. We chose them because they were the only restaurant that was crowded with diners. We were not disappointed and had a wonderful meal with excellent service. The lamb dishes are terrific. We had the 'feast' for two and all of the assorted dishes were excellent. Very nice atmosphere, too. We enjoyed Warda so much that we returned the next night for dinner as well."
I visited this Cote Brasserie on Saturday after going to the theatre it was very nice food was great service was good nice atmosphere. would recommend
"bar 55 restaurant inside the hotel so it was down in the lift and you were at bar 55.The breakfast was a buffet style,there was plenty of choices for everyone.Staff very polite and helpful and seating very comfortable."
"We Arrived for a special family dinner for the first time at HKK and loved it from the moment we stepped inside. Tranquil, beautifully designed and lovely staff. We sat at a very comfortable bar for champagne and cocktails where you can admire the lacquered Peking ducks revolving in their oven & the very impressive kitchen bursting with action. We had the 8 course taster menu - which the only choice in the evening and it was delicious. There is a vegetarian version of the menu which looked equally excellent.The highlight was the chef carving out Peking Duck and its flavours at the end he also presented us with seal stamped menus as a momento. The staff are well trained yet friendly. A really memorable meal - a work of art to all senses. Expensive but unlike many things in the world of luxury, worth every penny."
"Was taken out to lunch here and it was very good. I struggled a bit with the menu because I like plain low fat food but the spatchcock poissin, caramelised onions and green salad was delicious. Excellent wine choice. Have been before and would happily go back. Good atmosphere and service."
"My family took me to this wonderful restaurant for a very special birthday. The setting, ambience, attention to detail, exceptionally friendly and efficient staff, and the infusion of flavours of the set evening menu ensured a fantastic evening was had by all. The staff sang happy birthday and presented me with a beautiful slice and birthday candle which made my dining experience exceptional. Highly recommended."
"Short walk from St Pauls Cathedral following Evening service. Warm friendly welcome from staff. Choice of table, window seat chosen by myself for people watching on the street as lone eater. Good choice on the menus. Lamb kofte and flat bread would recommend- mint/mayo amazing!! Cherry eton mess very nice. Lovely meal, would recommend a visit. Cosy environment but light enough to read following my meal enjoying a glass of lovely house white. Would go again."
"Visited London earlier today for a show and meal afterwards. The show was excellent but our experience at Bella Italia in the Strand nearly ruined our day. On arriveing we presented a 40% off main meals voucher that we had downloaded from the B.I. website this morning.To cut a long story short, the manageress disputed the validity of our voucher, so we confirmed the offer via the Internet in her presence.She became quite belligerent but eventually advised us that she could offer ""another discount'' but would not elaborate. We therefore left and took our custom to one of their competitors nearby, who had no problem in giveing us an identical offer.Possibly B.I. staff are under pressure from above to resist discounts, but the company really shouldn't make these offers on their website unless they can be honoured.After all, we have a choice as consumers and on this occasion simply took our business elsewhere. Sadly, this has put us off using Bella Italia in future, but luckily there are plenty of alternatives out there."
"Excellent food and service. Unusual Italian food. The service was very attentive without being overbearing. Good atmosphere, not too crowded."
"We had our late lunch/early dinner at this restaurant. The staff were unattentive to us for our order and didn't come back to check if everything is ok but when we asked for the bill, they were quick."
"We ate full English breakfast and we couldn't manage to eat it all (note: if you don't eat much, order the small one, the portions are huge). Both regular and veggie version were tasty, although the veggie one was a pinch better. Prices are reasonable, as we ate two big breakfasts together with bunch of extra stuff, all together for 10 pounds (that was in 2014, don't know if the prices changed). The beer's cheaper than in some other pubs (London Pride for 2 pounds, while others charged 4). For a while we thought that the waiter's ignoring us, until we realized you had to go to the bar to order. Service was okay, food exceptional."
"We had a fabulous dinner for 30 guests including some vegetarians. The food was lovely although the portion sizes could have been a bit more generous. All the staff were extremely pleasant and very helpful and the events organiser, Natasha, was very kind and accommodating in the run up to the event. One point of note; the ramp to the restaurant is very steep at low tide and difficult to negotiate in high heels or if you have difficulty walking. I would have given this 5* if the portions had been bigger, but I will definitely be returning."
Fresh and plenty of choice. Nice ambiance. Well priced
"No fuss, simple menu, but tasty. The service was casual but at the same time effective. Decor is minimal and trendy. The dish selection is simple, yet varied enough to keep you wanting to come again."
"The restaurant is located on a boat on the River Thames. After you get used to the slight rocking of the boat it is not very disturbing, and the view from the boat is beautiful.The restaurant is a bit expensive and the portions are a bit small, but the food was good and the atmosphere and service as well. I ordered fish and chips, but I asked to replace the chips in a salad, and there was no problem. The dish consisted of a medium piece of fish, beer battered and fried, with a tiny amount of salad. The mushy peas that were a part of the dish were absent and we had to ask for the tartar sauce (and it was delicious). I drank Merlot. My husband ate risotto with parmesan and arugula and drank white wine.For dessert we took Eton Mess, an English dessert consisting of Meringue, vanilla cream and berry sauce. It was delicious."
"Yes, it's a chain. Yes, it's probably owned by McDonald's. Yes, they are supposed to have dubious hiring policies. But...... every morning I go there and get amazingly quick and friendly service at a price I don't mind paying. What's not to like?"
"I have never had a bad sandwich here. The food is fresh, coffee good, and one can get in and out fairly quickly. Good quality for the money."
"We got there at 6.00 and the restaurant was really busy but as my wife was looking forward to eating there and we had a theatre show starting at 7.30, I spoke to the staff there and they were really nice to us. The got us seated ASAP, we had our meal and they even gave my wife a birthday cake which my wife really enjoyed. Fantastic place to go... Brilliant service!!!"
"One of my favourite places in London. There is something special about yachts that makes a place look luxurious and cool. Nice little shops, several restaurants, the Dickens Inn pub and the Tower hotel make this place an enjoyable area to spend a day when visiting London."
I was in this place when was nice sunny day in London. Was really good. Nice terrace area and beautiful food. Busy but enough staff to serve us. Location is highlight definitely.
"We were at the St,Pauls Cathedral restaurant, I loved the fresh coffee and the sandwichs the pastries are delicious."
"I went with a couple of friends to have an iftar meal in sahara grill. Usually during ramadan, most restaurants offer a buffet service (which I'm not too keen on) but sahara still had their order from a menu service. I liked the love and care they put into all of our meals, and all in all it tasted very nice too. I am hoping to take my family there soon."
"They were very quick to find is a table, even though it was Friday night and we haven't booked in advance. The service was great, and the food was lovely! I had ravioli and Mac and cheese as a starter and my boyfriend had salmon (which I was very jealous off) and the steaks looked amazing as well. Definitely recommend for a nice dinner."
"I loved everything about this place! Environment is great, food tasty and staff very helpful and friendly! Xxx"
"I treated my partner to lunch and cocktails here for his birthday and we were not disappointed. The food was presented well and cooked beautifully, the service we received was excellent, the staff here were very welcoming and friendly and the service was not rushed, just the right intervals between courses.After a really enjoyable leisurely lunch. We sat out on the deck and enjoyed a couple of cocktails and enjoyed taking in the views across the river Thames! We got more than we bargained for as our attention was drawn to a large group of naked cyclists lol!! All in all we had a lovely time on this beautiful boat and plan to return.Thank you to all:)"
"After visiting the Natural History Museum and the V&A we needed somewhere in South Kensington to eat and have a well earned drink. We'd seen good reviews for Ognisko and we were not disappointed. We each had 3 courses and everyone one was delicious, 6 almost clean plates were taken back to the kitchen. We had a great bottle of red and a fab post-dinner cocktail too! The staff were helpful and attentive and seemed really genuine. ive never eaten Polish food before so had nothing to compare it to but would highly recommend this restaurant. Tip: it's not obvious where they are as they're not allowed to over advertise, but just head down Exhibition Road, it's opposite the college. You go in the same door as the spa entrance."
"ive eaten here several times as my husband and I hosted our wedding at The Royal Garden hotel. Great food, imaginative menu and well presented. Great staff, good service, recommend highly!"
"Strolled through Hampstead and found this beautifully located restaurant in a small street of Hampstead High street a few metres down from the tube station. On this Saturday noon, it was half full so no problems finding a table. The overall ambiente is traditional, with no ambition to create coolness or buzz. The Menu we got was in English with no mentioning of the actual Italian names of the dishes, which can make identification of typical Italian dishes a bit difficult. The food then was of very high standard, and we found that the waiters were friendly, with no attitude. After lunch were given the dessert menu and the waiter recommended Rum Baba, which we knew as a typical Italian dessert. What Arrived 10 minutes later looked more like a Tiramisu, and the waiter looked at it, slightly confused, agreed that it was more akin to Tiramisu and brought it back to the kitchen. Shortly after, a more senior waiter came back with it and explained that this was indeed a Rum Baba. When we tried it, we were however not disappointed at all, as it was extremely tasty. This place can also be recommended for dinner. Very enjoyable, traditional Italian restaurant with Italian staff and classical Italian dishes located an a very pretty environment."
"Fabulous service, staff are lovely. Food is good. Be careful with before 7pm 3 tapas for £10 menu, you need to request a separate menu as if you order from the a la carte they will charge you full price for each dish, that said prices are very reasonable. Good house wine :)"
"You guessed it, I gave The Mae Deli a visit because I'm a huge fan of Deliciously Ella. The food delivered on taste, just like the recipes ive cooked with at home, but the rest of the Deli as a business left much to be desired. Let's start with the heat. You know that feeling when you get off a plane in a hot country and the temperature difference suddenly hits you? Well that's what its like walking in to the Mae Deli. ive read through a few other comments and ive noticed the Deli replying with comments about getting AC installed, but these replies go back months and still no AC. Moving on to the customer service. When queuing up outside a member of staff came and asked if anyone wanted a table. I pointed to the window bar stool seats and said I would sit there. After paying for my food and going to sit at one of the bar stools, a member of staff told me that I could not sit there as these were reserved tables. I explained that I told the other member of staff I wanted to sit in, but she just said sorry and walked away. I was then stood in the middle of the crowded deli with a plate full of food and no place to sit. I then had to wade my way back through all the people to ask for a takeaway box. The person behind the counter happily obliged and transferred my food into a plastic container.Now the last thing I'd like to talk about is the prices. it was about £10 for 8 tablespoons full of food, really not much at all. I didn't dare go for a dessert or drink and I was a bit worried about how much the total bill would be! Every extra item, like a dollop of hummus was about £2 extra so quickly adds up. As I often make some of Ella's recipes at home, even using organic ingredients and sourcing local produce, I know how much the food costs to make, so I know that the prices are simply obscene. All in all, very Ella in terms of the food but in terms of the business and running of the place it is truly terrible."
"Have been visiting jamie's Italian quite a few times as it's alright for it's pricing. However this time, on a Friday evening, at 5:30 was turned away on a door because the rudest hostess I have ever met sai 'tonight is reservations only'. Okay I get that but at least she could have tried to ask if I wanted to do a booking for a later time or possibly for another day."
"Says it all really. Family friendly. Wish we could go back but service too poor. Took two and a half hours to have starters and mains and kids needed to get to bed, so have up and ha pudding at home."
I use TGI restaurants quite a lot when I travel and have always found this one to be one of the best. It can look a bit dark inside but I judge a restaurant on the quality of the food and service which I give the 4 stars to.
"I love this place. Everytime I am in London I always visit. For a quiet meeting (not at lunchtime or pub hours though) for a late lunch (Spanish time) for a romantic coffee or a beer with friends. My husband and I had the greatest fish-n-chips at 3pm in the afternoon... I only sit or eat in the pub downstairs, never tried the restaurant upstairs though. Should do next time."
Excellent pizzas. Not sparse on the ingredients. Not so common in many pizzerias in the country. Dessert was excellent. That's rare enough to be mentioned in this country as well. We took the cheapest £15 Red wine bottle which happens to be good even on a French scale of standard red wines. Good and friendly service. Nice decoration and in good condition. Enough space between tables. And quiet (wasn't busy though on that day). Toilets perfect.
"My husband eats here regularly whilst in London for work and wanted me to try it as well. We had beef tartare and oysters for starters, chicken with spring cabbage and chanterelle mushrooms for main and genuinely the nicest desert I have ever had - burnt white chocolate icecream. The only reason I have given Elliot's 4 out of 5 rather than 5 out of 5 was the mess up with our booking. My husband booked our table two months in advance and was given the choice of tables. Having chosen a window table he was called on the morning we were due to eat there to confirm a booking for the following evening. Having corrected them, we Arrived to be given a table at the back of the restaurant by where the waiters stand. Very disappointing."
"We visited IBLEO as we were drinking locally & fancied something to eat having never been before we thought we'd try it out. Food was good not perfect but definitely worth the money, service was great lovely young girl was very attentive. The problem is the restaurant we wanted to laugh when we walked in as it looks terrible like a run down shack it is so shocking it gave us plenty of laughs the whole night! My advice as a business person .. Close in January do the place up get rid of all the rubbish between the bar & the restaurant & then re- open they must change it because it looks so unprof ."
"Not sure if it was my late booking or the fact I was a table for one but I had to dine in the upstairs lounge which was fine by me. Same food and the waiter/barman did a fine job. I had the Cumbrae Rock Oysters, Sirloin steak which was served with chips (I needed to have ordered a side of veg) and a Chocolate expresso tart. All food was beautiful, upstairs was OK and service was excellent."
"This restaurant is a bit more up-market. The cuisine is Nepalese. Staff are very pleasant, as is the decor. Would not go regularly, just as a treat now and then."
"It is a tiny place, with little free space between tables. The food is excellent, the staff friendly and efficient, and prices are ok! There is also the possibility to take wraps etc. away"
"Wow, what a feast for the senses! The room is so colourful and vibrant. The food allows you to have loads of different tastes and textures. We loved it all. Great drinks selection as well. A great addition to Wandsworth. I'm sure we'll be regulars so I hope they introduce some weekly specials to mix it up even more."
Very authentic Italian with friendly staff! The food was great and we didn't expect to find such a good restaurant in part of the shop. Would definitely recommend.
"ive always liked this restaurant and eaten at this chain many times but I was dismayed to find out last night that now the items that they mark on their menu GF are in fact not gluten free! I was told they have changed the recipes and now some of the sauces ""may contain some gluten""! This is much more than just some traces and wheat used in the kitchen- this seems to be actual wheat in their sauces. I feel that's a real misrepresentation on the menu and positively dangerous for those who have coeliac disease. They've lots my business that's for sure. If you're not gluten free, the food is not bad but not riveting and it's quite expensive."
"My friend and I went to have some pre-dinner drinks, also hearing about their celebration of the Spectre film - where you could have vodka martinis for 7p (yes you are reading this right). Though this was limited for one drink per person, the cocktails were delicious and the servers were very attentive. We thoroughly enjoyed our drinks there and the snacks that came with them. The atmosphere was very enjoyable and I will definitely return to try the other cocktails on their list!"
Great for a city workers lunch - fresh and delicious.
"Visited Rules many times in the past - usually for special celebrations. The last time was Jan 2014. This time standard had dropped significantly. At dinner the service was sloppy -both first courses and main courses were given to the wrong person. Whilst it tasted OK, the presentation of the lamb and the duck was grey and unappetising, also one of the steaks was tough. Sadly the standard of the diners' dress was also scruffy - well below the smart casual that is suggested by Rules. Even a pram amongst the tables at 10pm! And for 4 people with pre dinner drinks (champagne £18.50 per glass!) the total came to just under £300. I will not be recommending Rules in future as I have in the past. Sadly, it is certainly not the place it once was."
"Booked the 'free flowing' champagne offer through afternoontea.co.uk. I read that afternoon tea sittings were from afternoon until 5pm, but thought that meant when the table had to be booked between. I booked the table for 3.30, finally table was ready at 3.45pm. Wasn't quite free flowing, had to ask for them to bring over the champagne after initially being told 'after the cocktail', and had to request the top up. We asked for more champagne at 5.10pm only to be told that afternoon tea was 'finished'. A warning or offer of a top up at 5 would have been nice, very much got the sense that they were out to save/make money, not to give great customer satisfaction. I went with my boyfriend so got one gentlemans afternoon tea and one vintage. The vintage came with 4 tiny finger sandwiches, but only the salmon and ham, so I didn't even get to try the full range. Gentlemans tea was better, savouries were nice. Scones were plain but OK, cakes were a little dry, seemed like they'd been sat out all day, but were OK. Basically it's only worth it if you get your monies worth with the champagne. Setting wasn't particularly comfortable or afternoon tea-like, as they try and sell it from the photos; it was normal chairs and plain brown tables. Book early in afternoon to get 'free flowing' champagne, or I would recommend saving some money up and doing it at a nicer hotel where they replenish food etc!!!"
"We dropped in to Cote for an early evening light meal. This is clearly a popular place, and we were asked to go downstairs as upstairs was reasonably full. The menu was creative and interesting, the service was surprisingly fast (we're still not sure quite how) but not over-bearing (aimed at the pre-theatre diners' market). A good meal to send us on our way. The environment downstairs was obviously more functional than relaxing, but it didn't feel stuffy or too hot, in spite of low ceilings and quite tight packing of customers. We could have done with a coat rack, though. The ratings below apply to eating downstairs - I think the atmosphere upstairs was much more relaxed."
"This is our second visit to the restaurant in two years coming to London for a city break.The atmosphere had not changed, a small but cosey ambiance, service was friendly and welcoming as before. Our food was truly Italian, cooked to perfection and could not be faulted.If you looking for an authentic Italain Restraunt were you get five star treatment, then look no further pop in today, you will not be disappointed."
"I had a big drinks party on the RS Hispaniola last Friday, and the staff really went out of their way to accommodate us. They were super helpful, and service was fast and friendly. I can't thank them enough for helping make the night a huge success."
"Didn't personally eat there but had a browse through the menu! Looked very fancy and definitely worth it- however- very steep prices for both drinks and food, but I guess that's what you pay for with the absolutely amazing view!Definitely a busy place, was all reserved since 11am today! (3/11) if I ever have the chance and money, will visit again!"
"After waiting 25 minutes between receiveing the starter to the main, the waiter brought our 'apparent' main course, which was incorrect, so the lady walked away. Two minutes later she walked back trying to convince us it was the meal we ordered, so we explained what we ordered and 5 minutes later, it Arrived STONE cold. I asked for mayonnaise for my chips and she brought it once I had almost finished. My friend asked for no salad in the burger and it came with bits of relish which had been clearly scraped out. We informed our waiter of the poor food quality and she replied 'well you should have told me'. The least she could have done was apologise and more so give us discount off the bill, but we had to pay full price. Such a shame as the food would have been fab. Walked out without a thank you. Overall, a poor service for a birthday meal which we expected to enjoy."
"Expecting to pay a little over the odds because of the 'celebrity' connection, I was looking forward to something a little bit special, but was sadly disappointed.Starters were quite agreeable, we had garlic mushrooms, fish fingers, prawn cocktail. Regrettably the mains were a let down, we all opted for the burger, both the meat & the bun were dry, the coleslaw was not a healthy colour, it looked like a ball of string the cat had brought up. But the skinny chips did cause us some mirth, they Arrived in a bowl with not one, but two chips in it (chips as in broken crockery), there were however a few more potato based products within the chipped vessel. For pudding, the apple crumble cheesecake & the chocolate brownie were palatable, but the so called 'cheese board' was another talking point, it may sound corny, but a cheese board looks a lot better served on an actual board, rather than a boring plate, & a selection of cheeses would have been nice instead of just two lumps, accompanied by 'seeded bread' which in reality was a piece of rock hard flat bread, (neither a bread, nor a cracker!) although quite tasty, would have been more enjoyable had it been a little more pliable. I am not sure how we were supposed to tackle this item, but were supplied a fork to cut the cheese (no knife!). The service was adequate, the staff were nice enough, but not overly attentive (it was late afternoon, it wasn't busy), but didn't seem to be aware that they were in full view of the paying customer when preparing drinks & food (possible hygiene issues here?). Overall I was not impressed with the whole experience, sadly it was a barely adequate meal at vastly inflated prices."
"ive eaten here a few times but not in a while until today. The food's ok. Nice, even. But this place has always been so full of itself, and after an awful experience having coffee and a bit of breakfast this morning I won't be going back. The phone was ringing throughout my time there. One of those really irritating, electronic-sounding phones. And the staff were ignoring it - they weren't busy, the place was empty when we walked in and maxed out at three tables. Ringing and ringing and ringing. Then it would stop, and whoever it was (we shall never know) would try again. Maybe they were trying to book, although it wouldn't surprise if this is the kind of place that doesn't take bookings. Maybe it was a supplier chasing late payment. Whatever, none of the staff seemed to care. If you don't want to pick up the phone, fair enough, but turn it off. Your customers don't want to listen to it. The too-cool-to-answer-the-phone-waiter clearly doesn't know what a capuccino is (although the lattes he decided to make instead were ok). And then - this is the best bit - when we come to pay he says ""We don't normally take cards, but I haven't got any change so I'll make an exception"". That sums the whole place up - even when they've got everything wrong, they're the ones doing you the favour. Sorry if this is a bit of a rant, but I don't think ive ever left a restaurant hating it so much."
The food here was great and the service was excellent. The staff were attentive but not over the top and they were very helpful with menu choices. There is a great variety to choose from and the food tasted great. Was an impromptu visit but would definitely plan another visit.
"Fantastic fish and chips - it's not very often you find a proper fish and chip shop, but this is definitely one of them!!!!"
"We (2 couples) enjoyed an excellent fish & chips lunch on October 10, 2015. The restaurant was clean and inviting. The food and service was excellent."
"No subtlety here. Flavour was substituted by spicy heat so you either had a paltry blandness or a palette of inedible red chilis. There was none of the flavoursome spiciness just unbearable heat. Servers were just that, no service, no advice, no professionalism. Restaurant was not my choice though I love Thai food, it is no longer the choice of our host either now."
"Eating Kelly's pie and mash has been a family tradition for decades and the one that's stood the test of time for my family and I is this one at the top end of Roman road market. The 'second one' closed down long ago and Kelly's in Broadway market fell off our radar a few years ago. I remember coming here as a kid on a Saturday early afternoon, when Roman road had a thriveing market and the queue for the pie and mash shop was always out the door. Now it's not so busy, but still does good business. ive since become a vegetarian and the pie and mash shop has kept up with the times by doing the traditional pies using vegan mince and they've even stopped using the eel stock in the liquor. The ladies behind the counter are always friendly and efficient and don't mind bringing your tea over to your table to save you waiting at the counter. In recent years they've introduced fruit pies, with the traditional pastry and fruit crumbles too. They also do chicken pies and gravy for those too scared to go for the liquor! And of course they still do the stewed and jellied eels. It's a shame that so many pie and mash shops have closed down over the years but fortunately Kelly's in Roman road is still going strong and I intend to support them by going every regular. Long live pie and mash!"
"We stayed at the Mitre on a Saturday and Sunday in July. The central Greenwich location was perfect for our son's wedding in the park. The bedroom and shower room were clean and functional, most of the staff were friendly and the continental breakfast was plentiful. The only drawback was that our 1st floor room over looked the beer garden which was lively until after midnight."
"Just had the Aromatic Duck and a Red Rumble, it was amazing. Very friendly and helpfull staff. Overall it was an amazing expirience. Will be back soon."
"I had a very nice meal with a friend one weekday evening. There we were - two women of a certain age, wanting a chat and a nice meal. An area of the pub seems to be, kind of, designated for food. But we were surrounded by drinkers - they seemed like university students, who were just drinking and were simply shrieking. It took the edge of the evening for me. The tables are also very scrunched together. I wouldn't want to eat there again, even though the food was very nice, unless there was a slightly separate area for eating. It is no pleasure to have periodic eruptions of shrieking when eating. Also - the music was just too loud - it felt like a student bar. I did twice intimate to the waiting staff, who were very friendly and efficient, that I just couldn't stand the shrieking. They seemed powerless to do anything."
"had afternoon meal yesterday, my first on my own, just curious and at the same time starving. but shall i say, i didnt make mistake when i decided to choose to dine in, the place, staff , food and drinks...they are all great! will definitely eat here again."
"ive been meaning to try hemsley and hemsley for ages, so I was delighted this week as I found the time for a quick dinner with my daughter whilst out shopping in Selfridges on oxford street Hemsley and hemsley are located on the 3rd floor in the body studio. A very quite location within Selfridges. But that was quite nice! The cafe is quite small but nicely done out in a very simple wayStaff were all nice, polite and professional.We ordered salmon burger which came with a side of slaw, dressed in lime and also a little dish of pesto the bun is not a conventional 'bun' but I loved it .....and the actual salmon was Devine and very fresh The tomato soup was also delious served with some type of black toast which was very different but Yummy a medium hardcore juice which was mainly veg but had a hint of apple and was very fresh ...and the choco shake which went down very well with my daughter . Cost around £40 for our order plus they put on an optional service charge . . Everything was absolutely delicious and will defiantly go again So really good for anyone seeking really healthy and nutritious food - guilt free!"
"We came across this place whilst they had a live band on. Absolutely fantastic atmosphere, and reasonably priced drinks."
"went for few drinks had great time! me and my girlfriend really enjoyed it the prices are fine too, but views are so nice there whole of London are visible. Not sure about the ques tho in cold whether."
"This pub is in a beautiful ott building with loads of seating (and some plugs for laptops). The prices are quite low and the beer variety is very good. I would be careful with food - it's very hit-and-miss. Love the bagels and the sweet potato curry is ok. Go for the drinks and the surroundings! I found the staff mostly friendly and relaxed, although I did encounter one lady who gnarled at me for no reason. Everyone else was great though. Free unlimited filter coffee refills until 2pm."
"we came across 'Jose Pizarro' by accident-and initially hoped it was a pizza restaurant-a small cafe style bistro,with a friendly welcome...we decided to stay as we both love tapas, but it was a disapointingly limited menu to try and choose a rounded selection from.the food was ok, what wasn't adding anything to our experience was 4 members of staff doing a curcuit of the small area-each taking it in turn to peer at every table...it really felt like being at primary school ! each time i rested my fork down for a moment someone would appear and go to grab a plate-or piece of cutlery- so we spent a lot of time pointing out that we weren't finished eating yet- with the cheery reply of 'no problem' ......what ?!?' yes-i admit i'm showing my age with my bugbear of the use of 'no problem' [and don't get me started on 'can I get'?!?!?!?!! as there are such a wide range of eateries in the area- neither of us would revisit"
Not great.We went there for to celebrate a birthday.I ordered with a friend the chicken which is £33 to share.It came with three roast potatoes and hardly any kale.The chicken skin wasn't crispy and tasted pot-roasted rather than roasted and was red inside which made it very unappetising towards the end of the meal.
"Truly one of the best places to go in London. We had some awesome beer (staff can really help you find a good one!). The burger was fantastic, the fish so well cooked. I can't wait until Sunday going back for their roast... game on!"
"I guess I eat here so often because our office is above a branch, that I am slightly bored of it. But it is reliable enough, if not the most interesting place to eat"
"Every time I visit this place it is just too busy, no chairs, no tables available. I know that will please the owners but it is a bit of a scrum. We have had some nice nibbles but it isn't relaxing. To be fair I don't blame the cafe but the station designers. They haven't allowed enough seats anywhere in the whole station. get a snack, not cheap but do-able and tasty but not memorable."
"After a long while trying to decide where to eat after a long day of travelling to London and shopping on oxford street me and a friend decided to go here. Happy hour on cocktails which was ideal, lovely and tasty cocktails and nice and strong. As for the food I can't remember exactly what burger I had but it was a chicken burger with all the trimmings. And I still say now that was the nicest burger ive ever tasted! Cheesy chips were lush too!! Can't wait to back here."
"I had bought two Travelzoo vouchers to treat my sister and brother in law to a meal out in celebration of their 30th wedding anniversary. It was an excellent decision since it would have been difficult to better the food, service and atmosphere for this special occasion. We Arrived early for our booking but this was not a problem and we were given the option of taking our cocktails in the bar or at the table. We opted for the bar and our cocktails Arrived in style along with complimentary nibbles. We were then shown to our table and introduced to our server, Nora, who was charming and very efficient. The restaurant had taken note of one of our party's allergy to mushrooms and Nora ensured that any food selection did not include them, without any fuss. We were then treated to four courses of delicious food of perfect portion size. My own choice of quail breast to start with rack of lamb as main course were both excellent as were the cheese board and white chocolate parfait pudding. Coffee and petit fours were also included. The petit fours were biscuit like rather than the chocolates I was expecting, but I am certainly not nit-picking about that! We were served generous wine by the glass and even our water glasses were top upped regularly without fuss. All in all a perfect celebratory evening out. The TZ voucher made the visit extremely good value for money but I concur with JemnTom that at £36 for three courses the menu is not exorbitant especially in a top notch location like Kensington. I also took note that they do a very reasonable pre and post theatre menu."
"My favourite restaurant when staying in Blackheath therefore was first choice for us, as a family, for New Years dinner. Unlike many restaurants there was no special menu at increased cost for New Year's Eve, normal specials and very good a la carte menu. Service was very good, lovely friendly and professional staff. We all chose different starters, mussels, charcuterie, seared scallops and beef carpaccio, main courses 20oz rib eye steak for 2, Breton opulent, belly pork all were pleased with choices. Had bubbly to start, then a very pleasant Cotes du Rhone during meal. Restaurant was full with tables becoming vacant but refilled quickly, service was still very good. Would recommend without reserve, overall excellent."
"On a business trip to London,my hotel sent me to Chez Patrick.One of the best meal i ever had in London. Great food and service with very affordable prices.A warm welcome awaited me by the owner and the staff was so attentive.I thoroughly enjoyed my evening there.I strongly recommend this little restaurant..a real gem."
"Had a lovely dinner, impeccable services, beautiful restaurant, try beat root soup the ginger and marengue sorbet"
"Stumbled in here on a saturday late afternoon and what a great little find. The upstairs restaurant at the George is welcoming and warm, with a open kitchen so you know its not "" ping dinners ready "". Great table service from the staff, attentive as well as knowledgeable. The atmosphere was fine and informal, the prices were very good 2 courses for 2 with bottle of wine and coffees £110. The menu is small but the food was great highly recommend the venison haunch sausage roll just wonderful. A added bonus was 20% off on showing theatre tickets before 7pm so only £90 gets better and better. Many thanks to the staff and chefs for a lovely time ."
Food is delicious and tasty. Consistent quality and service is great. Value for money. The big cheesy and muddy fries is the best
"Being a Middle Eastern myself, I can say that it's good being local to me but the food is not that great the passion of Arabic food is not showing there. Also the service is slow even though not that busy. They should definitely improve things"
"I like Jamie, that«s fact. When we visited Covent Garden I was surprised Jamie is here. We were hungry so we lunched here at Jamie«s Union Jack. British classics served at nice atmosphere of Covent Garden. Great place, welcoming and friendly staff, full of guests. We took nice fish and chips and a bottle of Sancerre. Because we were happy here for the first time, next day we went back again for the same food. Congratulations Jamie!"
Fantastic Thai food at very reasonable prices. Great pub atmosphere with outdoor seating area.A little of the beaten track but well worth trying to find it.
"Although the burgers seemed tasty when I looked what was served to other customers in the restaurant, I never had a chance to taste them.I paid for the burgers in advance to pick them up later for take away. When I Arrived, the same waitress I ordered with before was completely perplexed. It appeared that they accidently sent my burgers with some other order for someone's home delivery.I was very upset as these burgers were supposed to be ready as a treat for my friend. I was in hurry and there there was no point for me to wait 15 minutes for new order. I asked for the refund which was promptly processed."
"I last ate here 15 years ago! It has changed hands since but has retained that great, friendly Lebanese style.I have noted some of the reviews below and think a couple of comments are worth directing at them:Yes - the waiters are keen to serve you - that's their way - but they don't rush you - and they'll come back / advise / chat with you if you bother to engage with them and appreciate the cultural differences that make eating in a Lebanese restaurant so much fun.The restaurant is small and tables quite close together but that's true of so many other restaurants in London that it's hardly worth comment - it's certainly not a fair criticism!Down to the really important bit - the food !!! And this is fabulous. It really is! Finally - I agree with a comment on the house wine - I think it was unremarkable, and the bottled Lebanese wines could do with being more competitively priced and include a Chateau Musar late 2000s vintage.But, overall, it's great traditional Lebanese food and hospitality and well worth a visit."
"I waited in the ""wrong"" Coach & Horses for an age before calling friends to see where they were and cross Berkeley Square (in the rain) to the other one. It came as a pleasant surprise. I am a fan of the other one, on Bruton Street, but this is really rather nice. Pleasant staff. Nice venue."
"G Kelly is awesome. Absolutely loved their pie & mash. Also, they do the sexiest apple pies. Veggies, they cater for us as well as they do great soya pies."
"Hudge variety of beers and ales, and lovely food too. Always full of young people. Dishes are tasty, but a little bit too pricy. Last sunday we ordered a roast and for over 16pounds we got raw wegetabled. I'd rather wait few minutes longer to get a nice food that to be served as soon as possible. Anyway I would recommend this place and I'm sure I'll be back."
"great night at 28-50, we had a selection of small bites and a carafe of wine eachservice and recommendations were excellent and the food very good (brilliant triple fried chips!)lovely relaxed vibe with friendly staff"
"Located at the Hoxton Square, down the stairs, you find a cozy little place with fantastic cocktails. The bartenders know a lot about drinks and create one for you, if you tell them what type you like. They never disappoint."
"We booked lunch on Saturday 22nd August as we were in London celebrating our wedding anniversary. We ordered the tomatoe carpaccio as it was quick, no cooking needed! Nearly 1 hour after ordering and the main course being brought out before the starter the waitress came over to say there had been a mix up with our order and the starter will be out in 5 minutes! The starter came which was Pigeon! completely the wrong order!! We couldn't even eat them as we don't eat pigeon! The waiter took them back, no apology and didn't even come back to let us know what was happening!! The waitress came over and asked what had happened to our starters and went to get them from the kitchen. The waitress was brilliant, didnt get her name bit she had blond hair, glasses and an accent. She was very apologetic and very embarrassed and couldn't stop apologising. The starter came out and although it was lovely we couldn't believe we had to wait nearly 1 & half hours for sliced tomatoes!! The rest of the food was lovely! I wouldn't be surprised if there are more negative comments on trip advisor coming as lots of people were complaining. The only reasons we stayed was because it was a voucher deal so already paid for and the waitress being so kind!."
"I wanted somewhere for Afternoon Tea in London to celebrate my sister's 30th birthday. After lots of researching and reviews, I decided to go for the Park Terrace Restaurant at the Royal Garden Hotel. They had excellent reviews and me and my sister were really looking forward to it, until I received a phone call the day before. I couldn't understand her very well (not english) and she confirmed our booking for the following day. All fine. Then she explained that basically we had to be out by 3:45pm giveing us only one hour and 15 minutes! It wasn't until after I got off the phone that I had realised what a rush this would be! The whole point of the Afternoon Tea was to relax and chill out and enjoy the cakes and sandwiches, not clock watching because they had possibly double booked! Not my problem! I know some places do only allow one hour for Afternoon Tea (usually the cheaper ones) but there was no time limit listed on their website so I assumed there wouldn't be. In the end, we didn't go which we were really disappointed at, but thinking about it, if we had asked for more time, who's to say they still wouldn't have been rushing us? We also didn't want to waste the train fare, which is costly especially not for an hour and 15 minutes! The enjoyment had been taken away from us, and I'm sad to say and I won't be booking there again. I have been to the Chesterfield Hotel for Afternoon tea and they made us feel so welcome, they didn't rush us, we took our time and was allowed a 2 hour slot which I think is more appropriate. Maybe just a bit of bad luck, but won't be booking there again."
We went as a treat. The chocolosso was yum and the mango sorbet is delicious.Staff are really friendly and the setting is fun. We really enjoyed it but felt £15 totalWas a little steep. Go for a treat.
"ive only had sandwiches from there, which have been good. I don't know if they have more than that...but think the sandwiches are of a high quality."
"We Arrived shortly after opening at 12 noon and after reviewing the menu, made our choices. 10 minutes after that I was told that the pate I had ordered as a starter wasn't ready yet, so I selected the Crab & Avocado on Toast. Our starters were delivered, eaten and plates cleared. 10 minutes later, i.e. 30 minutes after we had given our original order, we were told the quiche was in the oven and wouldn't be ready for another hour!! (an hour to cook a quiche?!) The waiter apologised and offered to 'comp' our drinks - 2 x apple juice - just adding insult to injury. He then came back and said the waiting time was actually 25 minutes. Having already wasted 30 minutes we won't be getting back we ended up with a pretty average chicken salad. There were only 3 other options on the menu and all were salads - v limiting.For a venue not to have all the options on their very limited menu available at the time of opening seems pretty poor planning. We had much expected better."
We had a late night dinner here and dropped in without a booking. Food and service was fantastic with a nice simple menu and fresh ingredients. Wine list was also great and reasonably priced. We had the onion soup for starter which was lovely and I had steak with peppercorn sauce and french fries - the meat was tender and the sauce delicious. My friend had the chicken fillet with mushroom sauce and potato gratin which he also thoroughly enjoyed. I was in France recently and felt that the food here was better than most restaurants in Paris - highly recommended!
"We had an excellent lunch choosing the new set menu.We started with rare roast beef salad - beautifully cooked beef - rare and a generous portion.This was followed by lamb with onion tart and Spinage. Each element was superbly cooked and complimented each other well. The lamb was nicely rare, the tart an excellent a compliment and everything was tasty. Portion size was generous.We then had wafer thin slices pineapple. The fruit was in a lovely slightly spicy syrup and was served with a very smooth lemon sorbet.Service at the bar was very good.All in all an excellent lunch. The views are good too!"
"I discovered the restaurant whilst I was having an afternoon tea at The Ham Yard Hotel. Located in Ham Yard, near Great Windmill Street in Soho. There was a number of Japanese diners whilst we were in the venue which shows a good sign. We chose the 11 piece selection known as the Hakozen Bento Box which involves a selection of seasonal dishes. Their menu is seasonal so depending on when you visit, the dishes is likely to vary. My bento box involves a variety of cooked Kobe beef dishes, served with barley and edamame rice and a soup of kombo dashi, Chinese cabbage, sesame, chives, corn and onion. It looks very simple and the taste is lighten than the typical Miso soup you get. We also ordered the Kobe Beef Katsu Gozen, which included breaded Kobe beef fillet, served on a bed of barley and edamame rice. It is accompanied by nori, spring onion and fresh wasabi along with Kobe beef stock for making chazuke. It is also served with the kombu dashi soup. Although the dishes looked very small in portion size, it is filling. We was recommended by the staff to enjoy the lighter dishes such as the tofu and sashimi before the Kobe beef dishes as it is more heavier and we would be too full to finish should it went the other way. The Dashi Maki with Spicy Cod Roe tasted very simple, the egg omelette with a piece of roe on top wasn't anything spectacular to begin with. It was followed by the Fried Potato Salad in home-made tartar sauce with kumquat which introduced some flavour to my taste buds. The Fried Salmon marinated in wasabi and soy sauce was a little heavy, I haven't been much of a fried salmon fan for some time but it was slightly saltier than expected. But having some of the Pickled Daikon and Aubergine cleansed my taste pallet slightly before moving onto the Seabass Sashimi with Salmon Roe and Japanese Sudachi. That was a tasty dish and it certainly tasted fresh (I have had the unfortunate of tasting ÷off-tasting' fish before so I have been more cautious about it ever since). The same goes for the Tuna and Scallop Sashimi, both were fresh and delicate in taste. The Pan Seared Kobe with rosemary and white onion in Sukiyaki sauce started to taste a little heavy and this was the 7th dish. I couldn't taste the rosemary as much as I had anticipated, however the Kobe was tasty and the texture was just right. The Fried Tofu in Ponzu sauce and garnished in chive reminded me a little of ÷Agadashi Tofu' in many Japanese venues. The dish was very pleasant and delicious as a break before the next three dishes. The Yuba Maki with Seasonal vegetables and shizo roll was a very complex tasting dish. The shizo roll was covered in hints of tempura batter whilst the vegetables inside kept it's sweetness at the same time.The 10th dish consisted of Heavily Marbled Kobe beef with chilli and spring onion. You can't see much of the heavily marbled pattern on the beef unfortunately, however I do enjoy the use of chilli and spring onion. The last dish was the Slow Cooked beef with Doukon chives and yuzu zest garnish. It was tasty but heavy. I appreciate a good beef but due to the previous dishes, I started to feel very full. The use of yuzu zest brings my appetite back and I enjoyed the dish very much but you must appreciate the fact that there was a bowl of barley and edamame rice and a kombo dashi soup to go along the bento box. The Kobe Beef Katsu Gozen was also served with the same barley and edamame rice and the kombo dashi soup. It does look simpler and also very bland, however the Kobe beef fillet was breaded and then fried. It tasted better than the other ÷katsu' dishes you have in other venues and this is not the reason because it was Kobe beef, in fact it is because the fillet was breaded generously and equally, and I did not find a part where it tasted ÷breadless' and a part where it was ÷heavily breaded'.We were served by a waiter Ò he did appear to be more like a manager, was very passionate with the dishes and our dining experience. Carefully explained dishes and introduction made us felt very welcomes. I only dined at Engawa for lunch, therefore I will suggest a dinner reservation to experience more of the Kobe beef selection."
"This pub is in the heart of Shoreditch--which is kind of the Brooklyn of London--and we were the only tourists to be found at the place. It has a good beer selection, plus the prices aren't jacked up to cater to tourists, and we had a great time getting to know people from around the neighborhood. There is indoor seating, but on nice evenings, people often linger outside and drink on the curb. I would definitely recommend if you're looking for something slightly off the beaten path."
Booked weeks ago. Table for 5 at 10pm on a Friday. Greeted by a sour faced young woman who appeared to be upset that we were 10 minutes early to a half full restaurant. The manager tried to put 5 men on a table barely big enough for 4. We asked to be moved. We stood in the middle of the restaurant like lemons. Appalling attitude and service. The place smelt musty and damp. We left before sitting down. No atmosphere. Read my reviews. I know quality food and restaurants. This place is stuck in the dark ages. Horrible. Avoid!!!!!!
"My first time here, though partner had a mediocre meal a few years ago at Christmas. This meal changed her mind about the place. The first thing to say is what a lovely atmosphere there was. It was hot and sunny, people were eating outside, whilst inside the tables were full and people were drinking at the bar. It felt very authentic also. They sold Spanish beers and good Rosado. it wasn't cheap but the food was of a decent quality, and 4 dishes + bread and olives left us full. This came to about £30 excluding drinks. Was pleased to find the garlic dishes had lashings of garlic. Really liked the chorizo and the gambas, though the tortilla was average and the chicken in garlic was a bit gristly. Excellent service. Will return."
"Clean, Immaculate surroundings, great quality food (pastries are fresh and inviting) and attentive service all make for a real treat."
"I went there on a Sunday afternoon, and I was looking for some comfort food, but healthy, and I pass on the front of Matulka, I always wanted to try it, and I didn't regret it! The food is amazing, large portions, you have a lot to choose, the employees are nice and friendly, I left with a big smile.The price is low for London standards and for the food you get.I totally recommend you go there!"
"I'm writing this review as I have been waiting a long time on a response from union jacks, I have sent 2 emails and still no reply so I don't thing any body will reply here as well.My wife and my self went to union jacks on our trip to London at the end of February for my wife's birthday, I ordered the burger and so did my wife as we do eat in a few of Jamie Oliver's other restaurants mostly Jamie's Italian in edinburgh or on the cruise ship when we are on a cruise going to Jamie's Italian on the cruise ship next month.And I normally have the Italian burger and this is nice so I said to my wife to give the burger a go, So we both ordered the burger, My burger was ok not the best just ok I could eat it, My wife had to bites out her burger and on the second bite she found a hard bone, We called the server over to explain what my wife found, The server went and go someone else and they removed the meal asking if my wife would like some thing else, But as it meant my food would go cold or we would not be eatting together my wife said no thank you, I don't know but when I go out for a meal with some one I like to eat at the same time as them don't know about other people, My wife asked why there was a bone in her burger and the person that had taken the meal away said they don't know, I will say they did not charge for my wife's burger, On returning home my wife emailed Union jacks to ask why there was a bone in her burger but no body can be bothered to answer where I find this very sad indeed, at the end of the day I can only think that they must not be wanting people to know what kind of meant goes into there burgers, maybe it is all the left over meant with the bones I don't know because no one at Union jacks can be bothered to answer emails and the servers in the restaurant say they don't know why the bone is there,"
"The pre theatre menu at this bright and cheery restaurant is a good value. I had the steak/frites and dessert and my husband had the fish and the salad appetizer which makes for a good meal. My steak was not very hot when I cut into it and the management was so happy to replace it - and the fries! Very eager to please place, in a great location."
"My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday meal, and I absolutely loved it. Although it was expensive, the food was beautiful and the ambience was great. So we decided to take our parents a few months later, the ambience was still lovely but the service and food was not to the standard it had been previously. The waitor got our steaks mixed up and had no idea whose was cooked medium and whose was medium rare, so we each had to cut into our steaks to decide which one was which. I found this very inconvenient and slightly embarassing as I had praised the place to my parents. Once we had the right steaks we began to eat our food and instead of the chunky, hand cooked chips, we were given McDonalds-like fries, which I really thought deducted an element of class from our A la Carte menu meal. There was no longer a choice of sauces to have with our steaks, only Hollandaise which was very oily and if I'm brutally honest seemed to be nothing more than a pre-made packet sauce. The quality of our meal and error with the service of our steaks disappointed me, especially for the price we were paying. After this, I do not think I would visit again."
we were waiting to get into the puzzle room nearby - had 15 mins to spare so stopped for a beer here. Very friendly staff in really cosy surroundings - loved it
"We went to the Aqua bar after a lovely lunch in another of the restaurants on a Sunday afternoon. We were very lucky and found a table by the window so we could see right out with no one in front of us. Cocktails were great (the peanut and popcorn was so delicious and smelt just like the cinema!). They are pricey (around £16.50 each), although this is cheaper than a ticket to the viewing deck. Small niggle from the husband regarding the selection of beers being quite minimal, but the wine list is pretty extensive.Service was quite slow, especially when ordering a second round of drinks. Bill for 4 (7 alcoholic drinks) was £80 as service was included. Stunning views, and would definitely recommend on a beautiful clear day."
"Food was good as was service. Our waiter was very accommodating for vegan dietary requirements, explaining the menu very well and offering suggestions - probably one of the best experiences with regard to someone taking time to explain that ive seen.Food was tasty, restaurant decor could be improved, I think for the price, the restaurant could feel a bit more ""exclusive."""
"Well, I have to say, had we not had a booking I think we would have walked straight past it as it looked a bit past it's sell by date. But, on the inside it was a different matter. The location is ideal as it's near Waterloo train station and you have a fantastic view of the London Eye. The staff were very welcoming and attentive.We had booked through Bookatable and the majority of reviews on here seemed positive. I have to say we had a thoroughly lovely 3 course meal and a glass of wine. Couldn't fault it at all. Will definitely be back. Thank you for a lovely evening."
Visited the restaurant on 18th November. Had booked a table for 1-30pm. Although it was not ready on time the staff were very attentive and helpful - indeed their warm welcome from the moment we stepped into the establishment was very much appreciated. Had time to consume a couple of drinks at the bar before being shown to our table.Very professional waiting staff - and for once we were not asked if our food was fine. I am of the opinion that I do not need to be asked that question in any restaurant as if the answer was negative I would have made my views know without a prompt!Our food was exceptional. The portions sufficient and a delight to eat. My wife chose the lobster and in her view (teaches Catering) it was the best lobster dish she had ever eaten.The whole experience was exceptional and although it had taken us some time to get a booking at Scotts I suspect we will be returning!
"Cosy tapas-restaurant in the Notting Hill/Baywater-area. Friendly staff with spanish accent. The cured ham and the Manchego-cheese were superb. The squid as well. The potato ali oli was a bit tasteless, and the bread was more british than spanish... Not the cheapest place in the area, but worth the money."
"Visited on Saturday with friends we all ordered something different. Starters were, Asparagus, pasta pomodore, ham and melon, tricolore all very good. For mains we had, liver, veal piard, tuna, risotto with truffles. all Arrived hot and as it should be served. The restaurant was busy and full of atmosphere, all you could want from our local Italian restaurant."
This has been my local for years. Lovely owners and delicious food so I would recommend it. They do take out and delivery too
"It's been a couple of years since I was last at rules...having said that, very little has changed...the menu has changed a little but not so much that you would notice...there was a time when rules really stood out....but with time, others have caught up and there is a lot of choice now.I went on this occasion due to location near the train station for the out of Towners and the venue we were visiting afterwards....and other places were booked up.First time visitors...especially those that don't eat out a lot, seem to like it. It is not the favourite it used to be for me.Having said all that, the food was very good...although my foie gras was very cold and that made it taste fatty and have a somewhat lesser taste....the venison was delicious...cooked medium rare.Others had oysters, game soup, gratin of hare and roast partridge...all very good. We did not have time for desserts or coffee.All in all, a good visit but not outstanding."
"Covent Garden restaurants are usually pretty expensive but we came across this gem quite by accident. Prices for food and drink were on par with our hometown (Windsor). We were delighted with the pub/restaurant; friendly staff, very generous portion sizes and great value for money. Have already recommended to lots of friends and can't wait for our next visit!"
"I visited the takeaway part of the restaurant on Friday. I asked if the cod was line caught, a common question these days and one we are encouraged to do and one I believe we should. I would also expect a restaurant/takeaway that specialises in fish to have a grip on where their fish comes from. I was spoken to like rubbish, was told they didn't understand what I was asking and that no one asks this question. The staff behind the till then all started talking about this and mocking me. I was told how would I expect them to know where the fish comes from and how it is caught. Needless to say I didn't purchase my meal from them, I would encourage you not to until they understand the origin and manner to which their food is caught."
"ive been there with 2 friends. We did not have to wait long although there was a long que in the street. The pizza was delicious, very Italian style and the ingredients were fresh y abundant. The service is not deluxe, they just take the order and bring it, no one is checking if you are ok or need something else. Anyway for the price you pay the place is attractive and the food very nice. We spent less than 25£ for 3 pizzas."
"Had a lovely pre movie drink and sandwich at the Scoff and Banter, Leicester Square. Great Location and nice atmosphere."
"This branch of Dim-T should really put itself in order. Went there for a take away the other day, the restaurant only had about 4 full tables, I only ordered 4 portions of dim sum. They told me it would take 10 min, after 25 min I asked why it is taking so long. No explanations. We have been to the Charlotte street branch a couple of times, which is much better in service, not so much the Victoria branch. I will just find another take away place in the neighbourhood as Dim-T is not worth it."
"I am impressed by Jamie Oliver, but this time he has not succeeded. Boring, greasy food. Small portions. Slow staff. Sorry, I will not return."
"We had 40 minutes before the matinee of warhorse started on saturday and what a great place for a pint and some food, sharing platter. Good beer, nice atmosphere, friendly and good food."
I was looking for somewhere near my office for a beer or two. This came strongly recommended and was busy but not heaving on a Tuesday evening.The beers are well chosen and in good condition. I'll be going back.
"Fish curry and coconut rice, spring rolls, pad thai and 3 drinks for nearly £40. Was tasty but Thai food just shouldn't be that expensive especially for the portion sizes given. Good service, would recommend but wouldn't necessarily return in a hurry."
"We came here based on a recommendation from a friend, but after only a few minutes we could see that the menu was quite expensive. Thinking that this was because the restaurant was vegan and organic, and must therefore serve food of a high quality, we decided to give it a try anyway. My dining partner and I ordered two menus to share, a sushi menu and a tempura udon menu. Unfortunately the sushi was of a very low quality, with a piece of red bell pepper as the sole topping on one of teh nigiri. The same went for the tempura. This would have been fine if we had been charged appropriately, but at almost 20 quid a menu this was ridiculous. Would not go again."
One of the best meal I had in England!The food is excellent and the natural wine also! We had a really good service so we spent an excellent moment! Thank you Elliott! :)
"Reviewed this top Gordon Ramsey venue last year and it has not disappointed in 2016. While the restaurant is high end I would particularly recommend a visit to the upstairs bar. Great atmosphere, a full range of cocktails and exceptional personal service which is rare these days in central London. Paul is the stand out - he always makes my guests and me feel welcome and is the one who really goes the extra mile to make it a special evening."
"Food outstanding. One of the best Indians I have had in a long time. Service was very good with staff friendly, courteous and helpful. I don't often give tips but I did here. Go there you will not regret it."
"We met some friends who live in London, they recommended this restaurant, the food was excellent and the price was all in for three course meal and unlimited Prosecco. It was very good value."
Excellent food with excellent price! The house wine is also definitely recommended. The restaurant has a very warm and friendly environment
"I went with some friends and took advantage of their January 3 course and a glass of Prosecco offer. The food was really very very good. An amuse bouche Arrived first which was beautiful, all starters and main courses were excellent (the venison was stunning). Desserts followed, my rhubarb was nice but not stunning, everybody else enjoyed theirs.Overall it was a great experience, the wine is reasonably priced and overall the evening offered good value for money. My only complaint would be the room lacks a bit of atmosphere. It's fine if there is a group of you but the room lacks a bit of style."
"Hello all (the title is a poster on the wall).Although this is not the first restaurant I would choose, the smell taunted me to go inside. Inside the smell was great and the staff where very friendly. I was seated in the front of the restaurant and ordered a nice glass of white wine. I ordered a good starter, and the main (mum's Chicken Curry) was fabulous (thanks sanjay for your advise). after the meal I wasn't to full so there was some space for a desert, take the matka kulfi that is great. and all of that with some great lounge music (don't take coffee afterwards they are great in curry but not in coffee). in short: great food, friendly staff and nice music. perfect guysgreetz... Jasper"
They have good fresh food: soup is what I really like! (It's not easy to find the good one) Good smoothies! Stuff are pleasant) good location.
"I visited with a mate, the staff were very friendly and attentive. The place looks very upmarket but the food is also upmarket. The prices are reasonable. The staff dropped a few items...luckily not ours. I would recommend this restaurant. A good wine list!"
"What a nice treat! This is a great place for people who are yearning authentic Malaysian food made by the owner himself. The restaurant itself isn't much to look at, but the food makes up for that! Makan is also a nice place to stop after taking a walk around the Notting Hill area.FYI - if you need to use the restroom whilst in the Notting Hill area, Makan allows non-patrons to use theirs for 20p."
Good value and excellent service from Paulo . Attentive and friendly. Good protions and very tasty food.All together good experience. Definitely will be coming back.
"Slow service our order was taken quickly but we waited ages for our food. It was very busy and you are cramped in such a small space but I guess that's just London in particular?Food was fab and tasty, I can't fault it. Well cooked and succulent. I probably would go again if in the area."
We visited the North Audley Street branch of Prezzo one sunny evening. There is some outside seating however this was busy so we say by the window instead which was fine. The service was great... friendly and attentive staff. The food was delicious as usual. We had a voucher which was accepted for most of the food on the menu which was great as we had a good selection to choose from. The location is great.. Just off Oxford Street and there is a nice atmosphere in the restaurant itself. Will keep visiting this place as I am never disappointed!
"The staff were really welcoming and friendly, catering to you effectively, the food was just how I expected, came out nice and hot and not too long a wait between ordering and receiveing. However a member of staff came round the tables when we were eating shaking a bucket in our faces asking for donations which was rather rude with us being half way through our meal .Also they squash the tables in meaning that me and my partner were in fact on the same table as two other couples which made it a bit uncomfortable."
I normally love a Giraffe dinner with my husband and our two young girls but this one was different. We were seated and then waited 10 minites to place our drinks order( there was only us and two other tables and lots of staff) which then took another 20 minites to arrive! We then placed our food order which Arrived quiet quickly and the food we had wasnt bad but there was hardly any of it!5 pound for a bowl of pasta and ketchup is a bit much! mins later we were all done! This is not the Giraffe that we no and used to go to alot will think twice before returning.
I will be back when I visit England next! Thank you for the great hospitality. Was very noisy but otherwise great.
"ive been to 3 or 4 of the Busaba Eathai's in London, and this has become one of my top ones. I went on a Saturday late afternoon, and it wasn't too busy, surprisingly. Usually I have to queue at any of the other locations.The food we ordered here was really fresh and a lot of care had been taken. I went to another Busaba Eathai a couple weeks after visiting this one, and ordered 2 of the same dishes. It was obvious they had not taken the same amount of care. It was still good, but the Westfields Strafford one was a better experience overall even though ive been to the Bird Street one a fair number of times.The service was good and friendly as well. ive definitely come again. It's not too expensive here either - I find the prices are quite reasonable.I like the casual dining aspect of it and the variety on the menu. Definitely a return visit to be made. Hopefully, these guys keep up the standards and don't start deteriorating as it gets busier!"
"Enjoyed the lobster there (you can have it either grilled or steamed) which tasted fresh and came with salad and chips. Had a chicken burger which was nice as well. Hardcore looks smallish from outside but is really spacious once in, the service was amazing (polite and really smiley). If you are new to lobsters this is a good place to start..."
"My partner and I went to Latium for a pre-theatre meal. I had the fixed price menu and my partner had the a la carte. The design of the room is very nice with the tables placed fairly far apart making it good for an intimate meal. The service is good but never intrusive. The food was excellent, my partners courgette flower starter, with shaved truffle was very, very, good, and an imaginative balance dish, see photograph. I had the belly pork as a main it was beautifully cooked. We would certainly go back there and I wish the restaurant which is under new management all the best."
Whoever I take to this place they are always very happy with my choice of restaurant. Dishes are fresh and none of that oily sauce that you get in too many Indian restaurants in London.
"Still sitting in here actually... Two waitresses behind the bar, 20 people queuing up to order, on a busiest Saturday before xmas. I ordered food earlier, got something else on my receipt. Few rather rough looking customers around. Ended up here only due to accompanying work clients. Awful."
"Well, it is an Argentinian restaurant so you wouldn't expect anything other than great steak and wine - but it certainly delivers on both.We went simple with steak and salad and empanadas for starters and all of the dishes were spot on. All topped off by trying some potential new wines for the menu.Great friendly service - all in all a cracking night."
"Been going to wasabi for lunch since it first opened. Good food can't complain for lunch. From the starters to mains whether fresh from the deli side or premade from the fridge. Love the noodle soups, teriyaki chicken, gyosa and bento boxes. However have to say the service over the years has dipped from time to time, I mean its not difficult to have one queuing system and stick to it. They have tried several over the years and a few times its been a pain in the rear, especially when your rushing at lunch. However would recommend for a reasonably priced lunch."
Lovely dinner after work at the yummy dim t! Veggie dim sum definitely recommended! Lovely friendly waiterThank you! :) :) :)
"My boyfriend and I visited the restaurant for my birthday and we found it particularly romantic, charming and relaxing. The restaurant is part of Dukes hotel, hidden in a character building, in the heart of Green Park.The dining room was smaller than other places, but cosy and spacious for the guests to enjoy their dinner without having to hear the conversations of the next table as their own. The waiters were friendly, the service is great. The food was drag and full of flavours. We tried one of the signature starters- goats cheese and beetroot and loves it. As I have a sweet too my other favourite dish was the raspberry cheesecake with a good raspberry kick and a perfect ending to a delightful dinner. The reason I am giveing only 4 starts is that the place would definitely benefit a good sommelier as I am sure we could have done better with some advice."
"Located at the Piccadilly end of Brewer St., aka Japan Avenue, Ittenbari is the latest addition in a short list of authentic Japanese eateries in London.Ittenbari fills the void in the London real ramen experience. Taking over the premises of what used to be Ryo, a rather un-noteworthy Japanese eatery, Ittenbari has transformed the former's drab ramen into the real deal.The requirements for an excellent ramen are the ramen noodles and the soup. Ittenbari makes no exception to quality, shipping their ramen directly from the Japan. The soup currently comes in two flavours: shio and shoyu, miso to follow soon. Both have good depth of flavour that can only be achieved through many hours of prep. The shio is their speciality and the recipe comes from the successful Ryukushi Ramen Restaurants in Japan with whom Ittenbari are tied.I have to admit, I was a little apprehensive about the whole London ramen experience after being disappointed for so many years with sub-standard and often shocking attempts at ramen. However I should have trusted my instincts as I was greeted with an irashaimase from the chefs who are placed by the shop window, and sat to have my ramen.Ramen cooked to the right bite, soup complimenting well and with an assortment of spring onion, crisp onion, and the egg - I didn't realise how flavoursome a lusciously golden yolk could be! It was a joyous occasion and my slurping was the applause! Accompanying I had a ""side"" of charsiu-don, which was a lot larger than what I'd consider a side! The pork was moist and tender, seasoned and garnished well, I had difficulty knowing what to eat first - the side or the ramen! And to complete the experience, gyoza was a necessary accompaniment and a pleasing addition. All washed down with an Asahi Kuro Beer, not had that in ages and was hit with waves of nostalgia.You can order kaedama (a noodle only refill) - just leave enough soup in your bowl to accompany it, if you can resist gulping it down that is! I really wanted to order a kaedama because the noodles were sooo good and I can't remember the last time I COULD order it, but I was already fit to burst and very satisfied.With a big smile I sigh with relief - London has finally got a proper ramen shop!"
"Lovely place, came for 2 for 1 cocktails but was also surprised by the tasty burgers they have. A great place for a night out!"
Very reasonably priced beer and food. Burgers excellent and good service. Noisy if you want a chat though. Good range of craft beer - bottles and tap. Worth a visit of you're passing.
"I love DimT in Victoria; the food is great and it's reasonably priced for Central London. We ate dinner on a Friday evening - it can get busy so we had rung ahead and booked. We were greeted warmly on arriveal, and were offered the choice of indoor/outdoor as the weather was nice, but we opted for indoors. To start, we had some of the dim sum - these are what were recommended to me the first time went, and there is a wide range, all delicious. We went for a couple of the chicken options, and they did not disappoint.For mains, we went for Pad Thai and Katsu Curry - nicely made and very tasty. We had banana fritters and toffee sauce and chocolate brownie for dessert - very good indeed, as were the double expressos we had too.Drinks were Tiger beer, a very zingy and fresh tasting mandarin mojito and water.On this visit, service was great up until the point we ordered pudding. A couple of larger tables Arrived at the same time - then they kind of lost it a bit service-wise and we were overlooked for around 25 mins from ordering our pudding, to getting it. That was the only bad thing, and it has not happened to us in there before.In terms of accessibility, its easy to get to, and well laid out, so disabled access and pushchairs ought not to be problematic. Disabled facilities are upstairs, with the other bathroom facilities downstairs."
"Came for lunch last Saturday ordered the club sandwich and my friend ordered californian wrap, generous portions at reasonable prices £1 for load of chips you can't go wrong for a quick bite to eat."
"Been here a few times, it very alike to vinoteca but normally a little quieter for some reason. Not had a bad dish yet, always a good worker if in Oxford Circus area."
"Advised of 30 minute wait, was actually 50 minutes. Waitress not interested, slow, took 10 minutes before taking a drink order, 15 minutes to bring the drinks. Food was even slower. Didn't come back to ask if more drinks were required. I had ribs, no wet wipes or extra napkins provided. Ladies toilets covered in tissue, sinks blocked. The food was ok but certainly not good enough to cover for the rest of it. Would recommend you go elsewhere."
"These sarnies were excellent! Opted for the beetroot one and wasn't disappointed - a bit pricey perhaps but very good, & will be trying the sweet ones for sure! Only downside is they were a little slow for a lunch hour trip, but does mean it was fresh."
"Had lunch here with my daughter recently. Amazing food as part of an imaginative menu, if a little over-priced, but the downstairs area was incredibly hot."
"A lovely pub with the best staff in EC1! The rooms are amazing and a total surprise on expectation, its only a pub you think...until you see the rooms. I hosted my wedding reception here. I placed several friends in the rooms. The guests for the evening all had a great time and they all mentioned how accommodating and fun the staff were. You will find the finest Martini expressos in town are made here! Plus some of the best fun.Thnak you One Tun and all for a fantastic event... I look forward to visiting again very soon!! You're a very special place in my mind!"
"We bought a Travelzoo deal for the Park Terrace Restaurant expecting to get an average experience for the £59 cost. However our expectations were well and truly surpassed. The cocktails to start with were amazing, prepared and served by a very friendly and skilled barman. We were then shown through to the dining area which is relaxed and not at all stuffy or pretentious. The menu was excellent with plenty of choice. The food was fantastic, with just the right amount of time between courses. The waiting staff were all friendly and attentive without being sycophantic.We will definitely go back, with or without a voucher because even at full price it is good value."
This was a great choice for lunch - so much history must reside within the walls and although it must have changed significantly it seemed to retain a great character. We booked in advance for a late lunch so there were not so many customers there.We just had a main course and desert and the food was really very good - a lot of classic British dishes executed perfectly.Only complaint was the 1 hour wait to be served. Good price all things considered.
"This is a terrific value, up-market restaurant for a pre-theatre meal. The menu was inventive, the service impeccable and the quality and presentation of the food a really high standard. Couldn't believe we got a really excellent 3 course meal with a welcome glass of prosecco for under £25 per person in the West End. Lovely guinea fowl ballotine to start, delicious pan-fried haddock for a main course and yummy chocolate marquise to finish. Highly recommended - we will go back."
"Unfortunately it really came down to service.We had to get up from our table twice to order drinks at the bar as the staff continously walked past us and didn't hear us calling for attention or even look in our direction. When we did order a drink at the table, the bill was given and settled and we were asked to leave the table before they had even Arrived!!The starters were left on the table and the mains came out. I had to ask the staff to clear the plates so that our food could be put down.The food was not warm and out of the 7 meals four were eaten and finished before the 7th had even come out. It was 5pm so not very busy therfore we couldn't understand the poor service and late food. Not a great birthday dining experience.We then had 30 pounds roughly, service charge on our bill which we paid to avoid the mood being muddied even more as it was a celebration dinner however this just added insult to injury. Every single table in the bar was reserved so we couldn't sit and enjoy the music. After a 2 hour journey to the venue, bad service and cold food, we left.Really disappointed. I think had the service been better we would have stood and enjoyed the pianist for a while!"
"I was so excited to check this cafe out as its the cafe featured in the TV show ÷The Apprentice' where the losing team visits. It is a short walk from West Acton tube station and is relatively easy to find. The cafe has simple cooked meals and I had a Jacket Potato with beans and cheese, it was a great portion and it tasted delicious. Most of the people in the cafe seemed to be locals and all greeted each other by name, we felt quite out of place but it was all good humour. The cafe sells mugs and flasks especially for keen Apprentice fans."
"I met a friend from Australia here for a catch up and a few beers. The warmth, politeness and efficiency of the three young women serving was simply excellent. The beer (we had London Pride) was also in tip top condition and properly served to the top without having to ask for it. There was some music but not too loud (better with none for me though). As I left I congratulated the staff on how they had performed and was met with three of the widest grins - it was a pleasure to be there, I shall go out of my way to have a beer there when I'm anywhere near."
"The views are fantastic as the hotel is right next to Tower Bridge. The drinks are pricey but in line with similar cocktail lounges elsewhere in central London. The service was fantastic; Nicolas was one of the best waiters ive encountered in London, and his cocktail suggestions were on point."
Stopped by for a drink at the end of our day and asked for a cider. The server was snappish and a bit rude. He was replaced by a lady who was personable and charming and she saved the experience for us.
"I went to Kobe's sushi after only a fee months after having been to Japan and immediately noticed it's authenticity. From the Kapanese greeting, the bowing, the cleanliness, to the very authentic and DELICIOUS food. I'd say it's probably the most authentic Japanese place ive been to in London.I'd highly recommend it! My next time I'd like to try the Kobe Dinner and Kobe meat (which I had never seen in London). It's super expensive but exquisite."
"I was surprised how bad this restaurant was when I went.Service is ok but the food,oh mine, absolutely inedible.My advice:skip it.So sorry to say this but that is the true,for me.The ambiance is dirty,the ceasar salad have seen better days and the meat,horrible.And I love Jamie Oliver,he is such a nice guy.Met him a couple of times and like his recipes,but here I do not no why it is so disgusting.Really poor.So sorry to say but that was the true for me when I went."
"A group of 6 friends went and we all had a fantastic time.The food was great, especially the lamb, and we all were stuffed when we left. There is a good selection for vegetarians and two of our group are gluten-free. We all had 3 dishes each which meant we were all stuffed.I would definitely visit again."
"Following a friend's suggestion, I popped in for dinner with my family. It was a Europa League night, and being it a sports pub it was very crowded, but we were lucky enough to find a nice table. We were served by the very general manager of the place, who very knowledgeably introduced the menu to us for us to make the right choice. Another manager, Italian like us, offered to let us try all the three different ales so we could order our favourite. The food was just amazing: towering burgers, never seen so big and delicious before! Scampi and calamari fried to perfection, you could barely see any oil on your fingers. Oh, and don't forget to try the cheesecakes, 7 (SEVEN!!!) different flavours, all accompanied by a choice of ice cream. Thank you very much to the staff, and to chefs Pedro, Umberto and Desmond for making our short stay in London even more beautiful!"
"Very fast service on the rapide dishes which was required as we were very pushed for time. The Steak frites high quality, good selection of wines by the glass. Staff pleasant and efficient.Returned later for the tart tatin and they had sold out. Offered free coffee which was generous but it was the TT my wife wanted!"
"Stopped by for a bottle of bubbles to celebrate our anniversary this evening. Before our other reservation. The host was very kind and friendly. And despite not having a reservation she was more than happy to find us a table. The place was incredibly lively. Lots of happy customers and staffs alike. Really good value for money too. A bottle of prosecco was only £20! We had more time we would most definitely have a few more!A great bar, with a great atmosphere to match. Highly recommended."
"Unfortunately we turned up on Mothers Day, my son taking his Mother for lunch with me tagging along. The cocktails were excellant as was the bartender. The starters were very hot and very tasty. The main courses turned up and one of which was lamb which was not very good, full of fat. The other two were ok dinners, nothing special but ok. The lamb was taken back to be re heated but it was difficult to re heat fat which was the main consistency of this dish. When it was returned, it was fat but cooked a little more. needless to say, the dish was left. I might say the Maitre was a little indifferent about it, telling my son that they only buy best quality etc etc but my son couldn't eat it. Puds were ordered and devoured.Both waiters that served us were very apologetic about the lamb and, to be fair the did knock it off the bill, along with a selection of vegtables. To sum up, I would say we were unlucky to get a piece of lamb that wasn't very good but overall we all had a very nice experience, albeit an expensive one."
"I have eaten at Goya's in Pimlico for many years and did so again last week. It is a wonderful restaurant, great food and always excellent service. It is well worth a visit."
"There is a bustling bar serving tapas at pavement level but the main restaurant is a cavernous place in the basement with no natural light. The acoustics are dreadful and ensure it is noisy even when few tables are occupied.There were plenty of free tables but we were directed to a gloomy little corner on the grounds ""it might be busy later"". We ordered a couple of tapas for starters and a main course each. When a party of 3 who had come in at least 10 minutes after us received food before us, we queried it. ""Mistake in the kitchen"" we were told. However, it became apparent that they'd requested rapid service. We did not realise that this was necessary...The quality of the food was okay but nothing special. The main courses, which were fairly pricey, were advertised as having vegetable accompaniments. These never appeared and we were unable to attract the attention of a waiter to ask what had happened. We mentioned the oversight when we paid the bill and were told ""we don't bother to bring those because because nobody ever eats them. We'll take £4 off the bill"" Then change the menu!!Overall, it was not a pleasant experience. We're looking for a new regular restaurant because our favourite has closed due to retirement. It certainly won't be this one!"
Took friends to the Hispaniola - loved the location. All 3 of us had the Flat Iron Steak - perfectly cooked - tasted amazing.
"Having read several reviews on other web sites, I had high expectations that Gurkha's would be in a different league to most Indian restaurants in your typical high street. Sadly, it turned out not to be the case. The food wasn't awful; it was simply average."
"We were pleasantly surprised finding this restaurant just a stone's throw away from Heatherfield b&b. We're always on the lookout of a nice veggie option and this was just the place. They were working on their alcohol license in July 2012 but you can bring your own. Shame though about the sake. Staff is still learning but friendly. We had to remind them of bringing over our drinks a couple of times... The food is very well presented and fresh enough. If you're (very) hungry, make sure you order/mix enough."
We took our favourite clients here on a Monday evening and only just managed to get a seat - such is its popularity. I'd thoroughly recommend their signature dish - octopus salad - truly fab flavours and very fresh. Service was prompt and no nonsense and the food was delivered at the right temperature (which many tapas restaurants get wrong). Will definitely be going again.
"We've been to Gurkha's twice now, and had one delivery. The food has been consistently excellent - fantastically seasoned and flavoured, but relatively light on oil and fat. The Momo, in particular, are mind-blowing. spicy hot, and intensely delicious. This is not your everyday Indian, it is Nepalese and proud. The usual Indian fare is there on the menu, but why anyone would go for that when the Nepalese specialities are far superior is beyond me."
Been a few times and I have enjoyed it the most with a chilly weather outside and when I managed to orde the right dish. I prefer the minced lamb as opposed to the grilled one which is a bit overrated. service wise there is room for improvement...the waiter grew impatient when I couldn't pronounce the name of the dishes..
My company has provided leaflet marketing services to promote Clerkenwell London and 155 Bar & Kitchen among the local community. They ignore calls and messages and I am still waiting for a debt of £900 to be paid. Please avoid all business with them!
"Tooting had been severely lacking a chippy for a long time so it was about time it got one. More of a take away than a eat in, the menu is very good with lots of choice of posh pies etc. Price of the food let's it down a bit though for me, I actually prefer the chippy in close by Colliers Wood which is a lot cheaper."
"Was charged £ 11.10 for two pints which later turned out be only £9.00 worth. None of the staff could give an explanation of how any 2 buttons could add up to £ 11.10 - I can therefore only assume that someone has attempted to steal £ 2.10 from me. Although £ 2.10 was refunded, I am still waiting for an explanation."
"Vapiano is one of my most favourite places to indulge in delicious fresh pasta. Love all the prawn dishes. I have been going to Vapino for several years now and enjoy it just as much each time. The atmosphere inside is inviting and its a great spot for hanging out with friends and having a good old catch up while eating amazing food. The desserts and yummy too, I would highly recommend Vapiano for all the pasta lovers out there."
"New York has Totto, Singapore has Ippudo, how come London with so many Japanese residents and visitors does not have a great ramen restaurant? Encouraged by the internet reviews, we went to Ittenbari, to be deeply disappointed. Well, it's not a bad as a few places in Paris where they must serve high-quality instant noodles with char siu pork, but the broth (for both types of ramen on offer) is mediocre and the varieties limited."
"Apart from being filthy dirty (eg bird poo all over the tables, which are obviously never cleaned), the staff are slow and rude - to put it mildly. Customers are obviously an imposition to them - and I include the manager/owner in that, who took delight in the fact that we found the service far from satisfactory. Getting service is slow, awkward, and nigh-on impossible. Stale cakes and croissants are left exposed, and I say, ""stale"", because both of the two croissants we paid over £5 for (£12 for 2 croissants and 2 lukewarm, flavourless hot chocolates is extortionate) could have been used as self-defence weapons. The manager (who claimed to be the owner) though this was hilarious, and refused a refund because we didn't have a receipt - we weren't given receipts! Family-friendly? NO. Dog-friendly? NO. do I expect them to be there much longer? happily, no. there are a couple of other places to eat and drink in the park, and nearby outside of it. bring a packed lunch or try them instead - much friendlier service and better priced."
Nice early lunchsoup and sandwich of tuna with fresh juiceend by pudding and coffee good service nice placeaverage prices
"Its a nice place to visit with friends. Nice music, clean drinks and normal prices. I will go there again for sure!"
"We went to see old friends in London and they took us to their local curry restaurant.Excellent Ò everything was good. The service with smiling, polite, knowledgeable and enthusiastic waiters, the food was fabulously well testing, and all washed down with Indian lager.Hope to be able to go there again soon!"
"Visited with 3 kids the week between Xmas and New Year at tea-time. There was no kids' menu but they thoroughly enjoyed the fish and chips. If you order a starter as well as a main, don't order the sample platter (whatever they called it). It was hot pork pie (surprisingly delicious), sausage roll, pickle and normally it has a scotch egg - it was a meal in itself and quite fillling. Good atmostphere and normally on a work-day it is apparently heaving with people (my husband works in London severally times a month). Would definitely go back for tea...and the cider was pretty good too!"
"Authentic, relaxed, organic, vegan, friendly, low cost, tasty, clean, fresh = PERFECT 10/10100% will be back."
"I'd only ever heard the name in a Roxy Music song, but when I got there it is SOOO Roxy Music. The main dining room is large and with a stunning staircase. The food was classic English cuisine (or that might have been my selections). Loved it all. Look forward to my return."
"Dropped in for a late lunch around 2:30pm not really needing much and this fitted the bill very nicely. I had a calorie-lean pizza vita with speck which was very tasty and my wife had a Gamberi Risotto and was pleased that the prawns were not like rubber as they can be in some places. Reasonable portion size for London prices, not very busy when we were there obviously so quick enough service by a friendly waiter. Not a large menu but a wide ranging one, so that is fine"
"This place has charm just off the national gallery museum and the restaurant room has a quaint and welcoming atmosphere. However two of the choices on the outside menu has disappeared when we got the menus at our table and another two were unavailable. So choice of food was very limited for a pre theatre dinner. More sandwich and snack type. The veal was tough, floating in oil and really unpleasant taste. Ham and bread were basic quality. The service was inattentive and inefficient. Given the price we paid we found it very poor value. This is the heart of the London West End and there are many better options nearby."
Visited whilst in the area for tea. We were seated quickly and given menus. About ten mins later our waiter arrives to take our food order. We hadn't fully decided what we wanted yet and presumed drinks would be ordered first but felt rushed to order. My burger Arrived to the table by a different waitress. No sign Of my partners burger. After a while I was about to ask what the hold up was when his burger arrives by another different waiter. Restaurant wasn't busy so I couldn't understand different people doing jobs - would prefer just one waiter. The drinks were free refills but we wernt asked if we wanted another drink till we had finished our meals- by that point it's pointless. Price isn't cheap but it's a chain restaurant so was expected. Overall it was ok.
"Nice wine menu, steak tartare was very poor. Far too large pieces and quite fatty, hard fried egg on top so no allowance for binding. Chips were lovely. Salad was saturated in olive oil."
"Really enjoyed the atmosphere of people talking, great beer and then someone in their wisdom decided to put the music on. Everyone had to talk louder - ambience and atmosphere destroyed."
"Very nice evening with my family, nice background music, friendly and efficant service and good food, the chicken is really really spicy!"
A brilliant outdoor space for lazy Sunday afternoon drinks with friends. Cool sheds to sit in if its cold or raining. Excellent Bloody Marys!
"We passed by this place numerous times as we walked to and from our hostel, and it looked like a normal cafe with a bar inside, nothing special. But then i caught a review of it somewhere saying it has spanish food that's really good. So when we arrive, we are escorted downstairs to their restaurant area, which is very nice and classy looking. Most of the waiters were older gentlemen, that took very good care of our small party. The food was most excellent, though there were some gripes about the duck being too done. My roasted rack of lamb was delicious though."
They dealt very well with the number of people on the day. All was going fine until the waitress took my plate away whilst I was still eating. Yes it was my last mouthful but where is the politeness?.Table next ot us was served theirmain course when the starters were still on the table. Special deal menu. We were not given one of these
Me and my girl friend was there for a dinner we found the place amazing and vibrant. We was surved very fast and the food was tasty.
"Not much on the menu except Lobster & Burgers, but what would you expect !Both were delicious, simply and swiftly served in a buzzy environment.Excellent pre theatre fun, fast meal."
I really had a great night !! the atmosphere is friendly and the staff is really professional..You must try the cocktails at the bar to fire up your night ...simply amazing!!everything we ordered from the menu was perfectly cooked and served...Cant wait to be back for another night !!
"We ate at the Park Terrace Restaurant for the first time using a Travelzoo voucher and the whole evening was perfect from start to finish in every way. The lady at reservations was very friendly and helpful explaining the deal. The cocktails were excellent and made with care and skill. It was a nice touch with nuts, olives, etc. The restaurant was laid out in an uncrowded manner and had very good ambience. The breads to start with were delicious and there was a good menu choice. All courses that we had were absolutely delicious and were served at a relaxed and unhurried pace, in fact we took nearly 3 hours and timing was perfect. Difficult to say which course was best, although highlights were the seared tuna starter with Bloody Mary sorbet starter, trio of lamb and the limoncello souffle, the latter of which had the best mint ice cream I have ever tasted. Superb and strong compliments to the chef and kitchen staff. The cheese and petit fours were delicious to finish with. Finally, the service was faultless from each and every waiter. They were very well trained, knowledgeable, attentive but not overbearing and overall superb. We were given a 25% off next visit and we will certainly be returning to this excellent restaurant. Thank you to everyone at the Park Terrace Restaurant for making our visit incredibly enjoyable and memorable. Totally recommended for a special night out."
Recently went to 68 and Boston with a group of friends from work. Great atmosphere for relaxing and having a drink. Was crowded but still very comfortable and the service was attentive considering the number of people that were there. Very recommended
"I was there with a group of friends, sitting downstairs. We ordered the entire menu' as we were a group of 10. The food is great even if, our fault, mixing all tastes at the same time does not help having a strong option on what's best! Very loud, not the most relaxing place but definitely a good spot, with an above-average offering."
"We hadn't heard of the Hispaniola until we were given a Virgin Experience voucher for dinner as a Christmas present. We waited until the weather warmed up a bit and combined the meal with a matinee performance of War Horse, which resulted in a fantastic day all round!Arriveing slightly early, we were welcomed by very friendly staff and shown to our table with a great view of the London Eye. A refreshing glass of Prosecco was served very promptly and we were given time to study the menu.For starters, I chose warm wood pigeon salad, with balsamic berries, celery cress and croutons, while my wife went for the smoked mackerel mousse, with marinated beetroot, beetroot crisps and beetroot mousse. These were both beautifully presented and absolutely delicious, as were the main courses - seared sea trout, with garden peas, new potatoes, sliced baby gem and asparagus in a lemon and butter sauce, for me and chicken breast, sweet potato rosti and asparagus in a mushroom and calvados sauce for my wife. Deserts of chocolate and orange tart and a trio of ice creams/sorbets, followed by coffee rounded of a truly delicious and memorable meal. Throughout our dinner, staff were attentive, friendly and interested, without ever becoming pushy. Lucien, our main waitress, chatted with us, took us outside on deck for photographs after our meal and could not have done more to make our dining experience one to remember. We will definitely return on another visit to London."
Terrible place to socialise or eat/drink. Poor customer service. Why put so many tables in if the customer assistant wants to move your table while you are seated to navigate the restaurant. No hot drinks available despite the advertising. I
only went in there because my arm was twisted have tried these places several times and to tell the truth absolutely awful huge language barrier with staff and service terrible to be avoided do not use unless you are desperate
Omg. Been here a few times since it opened 6 yrs ago and it is still really good. It is Sunday lunchtime pouring with rain and people are still coming in the crispy duck is to die for 6 pancakes onion and cucumber £11.95 for 2people the prices are good for Victoria so come and enjoy it is a big place so plenty of room and designed really well staff are all really cute !! Boys and girls !! My bill for me was £50 but included 2 big tiger beers at £6.50 each ( a bit steep) but what the hell. FAB place for great food enjoy x
"We loved Bar Boulud at the Mandarin Oriental. We visited for an earlyish dinner and the place was packed which is always a bit worrying, however, the service was super slick and speedy without feeling rushed. Great food and not outrageously priced for a deluxe hotel in London. My only criticism is the the tables are ssooooo close together that they have to pull them out to let you out, which is tricky when you need the loo! Otherwise highly recommend."
"I decided to try this restaurant yesterday based on the fact that it was in the top 12 of places to eat in London and had very good reviews on tripadvisor. What a mistake that was; never, ever will I step back into this unfriendly and unprofessional establishment.My father and I drove from Croydon and parked in the main area of Greenwich near to all the shops and slowly made our way to this pub. I was very much looking forward to it and after the long journey, could not wait to tuck into one of their homemade pies. It was quite a walk and my father who is 68 years old was also looking forward to it - even though it had been my idea. We walked into the pub and a lady came over to greet us. I asked her if we could have a table for two and she asked if we had booked; I said that we had not and were unaware that one had to do so. (There was no mention on any of the tripadvisor reviews of needing to make a booking). She said she would see what she could do and gestured over to a sofa area for us to sit down. Suddenly out of nowhere an older man came over to us and - what can be only described as barking; loudly and aggressively asked me if we had a booking. I repeated that we did not and he proceeded to address me in a rude and disrespectable manner, telling me that it was a Sunday and busy and one has to book - enough so that other customers in the pub turned to stare. I apologised and told him that we had driven all the way from Croydon and did not realise this. He continued to speak to us in this unfriendly way and seemed intent on just being unpleasant. My father then interjected and tried to reason with him, re emphasising that we had driven all the way from Croydon; unfortunately this man could not care less and did not adjust his tone towards us for once moment, remaining unprofessional towards my father. Trying not to stoop down to his level, I asked him politely if there was any way that he could squeeze two people in. His answer was an unfriendly no. He then said we could go into the pub next door and wait; he said there were other people waiting in there who also wanted a table. He was very confrontational and so we just turned around and walked out of the pub, mortified at what had just happened. Half way down the road my father said that he needed to stop for a bit and asked for the phone number of the pub, as he was very angry with the way we had been spoken to. He phoned and I believe the same lady picked up and he explained the situation to her and how he could not believe how rude and impolite he had been spoken to, not ten minutes prior. He was then put through to the same man and began to explain how there had been no need to speak to us in that way, etc. From watching my father attempt to talk to this man, I could see that the man was being his usual and rude self on the phone and obviously had no interest in the customer. He then hung up on my father.I don't think I have ever walked into a pub or restaurant in London and been greeted with such lack of respect and in such a hostile way. We were spoken to us like we were beneath him - perhaps we looked out of place in his pub, but a restaurant in London should be welcoming to everyone. I do not know why he behaved in this manner towards us. To then put the phone down on someone is unquestionably rude. Had he just politely told us that we needed a booking and apologised that we weren't made aware of this, all of this could have been avoided. Unfortunately his insolent nature ensured that this did not happen.I would suggest NOT bothering to try these so called pies. There is a great pie and mash place down the road called 'Goddards' which is friendly and welcoming. A restaurant needs to have good customer service skills and be welcoming to any one who walks through their doors and to be treated the way that we were was just shocking. This so-called gentleman should perhaps learn to curb his tongue in future, as I am sure there will be other instances of people who decide to just 'pop in' from outside; it is after all not a pre requisite to make a booking, especially when no reviews mention this. It should also be noted that I had previously tried to look for the menu online up until a few days ago but their website would not load (and still does not - I have just checked) and so I was unable to view any information.I would highly, highly recommend not entering into this unfriendly establishment and just keep on walking down to Goddards - unless of course, you want to be spoken to like a piece of dirt stuck to the bottom of your shoe."
"I have been to a couple of the other branches, and this one continues to maintain the good standards. Food is a little pricey but worth it. Have the Jungle Curry if you dare"
Vapiano serves Italian food with a fast food concept. Ordering is done yourself at dedicated Pasta/Pizza counters and made to order (you can really customise it). Food tastes pretty good and definitely fresh. Didnt like the seating style where people can randomly join you if there is space on your table making it impersonal. Wouldnt recommend the deserts - they seem and taste mass produced.Overall I would recommend for a good fairly economical Italian meal (basic) meal.
"I was staying overnight on business and had an early appointment on the Strand. I found Belushi's via Laterooms and felt that for one night I had nothing to lose.Belushi's was easy to find from Covent Garden tube station, and the room I have rented was abve the bar. Very pleasant staff checked me in and showed me to my room ""the Tennants room"". A very well sized en-suite studio flat with full kitchen facilitiesreally shocked me. Everything was pretty well trimmed and in reasonable maintenance. Free wifi and TV included.The bed was too soft for me, but for others it may be perfect. Residents get a 25% discount on food in the lively bar, and for dinner I had hot wings and a Caesar salad which were perfectly edible, and well priced even without the discount. I had a very comfortable night, and a fine meal at Belushi's: a highly recommended alternative toi expensive hotels in central London."
"The 6 of us went in this bar after going around London to have a late Sunday Roast. We had lamb, and pork belly, to be honest was everything nice and tasty. The waiters were very polite. If I have to say what it was wrong in there were the toilets and the basins, the water in most of them didn't go down. For sure next time we're going to London we're going back to this Bar and Grill Restaurant."
"My first experience was on August 2015 lunch time was a great experience that time, good food and service. I go back on 22 June 2016 All different! Different waiters. I try to call them 10 times maybe but thay thinking to play with their friends they meet in the street, no smile, no hospitality, when one of them I went there with my family come to me as a favour, Pizza (frozen dought) burned, and almost broken my theeth for a crab bons... wors Birthday ever. Manager after mine complaint dont apologize but with all evidence try to excuse herself... Completely unprofessional... Strada management send some Mistery to check your business otherwise that great location is just a waste of risorses."
Stopped by late Friday afternoon for a catch up with my niece.Great choice of drinks with a really good feel about the place.
The ambience is very British. The food was good but service was not upto the mark probably because of number of people as the restaurant was packed. We started with the portobello sandwich that was mouth watering and followed by steak and eggs for the main course that was a bit bland and upto the mark. The salmon poached eggs were great and the pancakes were delicious. Overall a good experience and service needs to be improved when they are busy.
"After dining elsewhere my girlfriend and I decided to drop into this attractive looking bar for another drink. We were greeted at the door and given the option to sit at the bar or a table. We quickly ordered two cocktails and they Arrived promptly. Highly recommend this venue if you want a quiet place to drink or eat, nice relaxed atmosphere with friendly and welcoming staff."
"My sister had purchased a voucher from Groupon which entitled us to a cocktail and afternoon tea for two. We Arrived a little early, the front of house kindly offered us some water while our table was prepared. We were then shown to our table. Then the waitress came over to explain the afternoon tea experience, giveing particular mention to the fact that we can have as much tea and food as we pleased. She also asked whether we had any requests, to which we told her that we both don't eat sardines could we have a chicken replacement instead. This was no problem, so a fantastic start. We then had a gin based cocktail which was refreshing. Then our actual waitress came to serve us, she asked the same questions as the first and we reminded her that we don't eat sardines. Anyway after a while our sandwiches and cakes were bought out our waitress very kindly replaced the sardine sandwich with a lovely coronation chicken one (was our favourite). We found menu misleading on the menu they had a fig and parma ham sandwich when in fact it came out as a tiny amuse bouche. It was delicious though. I had the Wellington blend and my sister had the park lane blend, both so good you didn't need any milk or sugar. We found the bread hard and stale. So far we were enjoying the experience (even forgiveing the bread) our waitress was polite and friendly. However, here's where I got annoyed, our sandwich plates were cleared without being asked if we wanted more, it was obvious we had finished the tea and weren't offered any. I had to ask for the tea to be replenished on numerous occasions, it got quite embarrassing and frustrating. We have been to the Langham, Brown's and Dorchester who also are in the same league as the Wellington Lounge, however their attention to detail is second to none. The experience there feels more special. Yes our waitress was courteous and polite and she did give us more tea after we had asked. But I felt that that should be part of the training. What made it worse that tables around us were constantly offered more tea, sandwiches or scones not ONCE were we offered this. We came to the conclusion that we were treated differently because we had a voucher. I didn't want to pay the service charge but my sister thought that the waitress was friendly and deserved it. I know I must sound glutinous, but I'm used to a certain level of service when I have afternoon tea in london. Not used to eating stale sandwiches and made to feel embarrassed asking for something like tea which I paid for! I subsequently raised the issue with management who responded three days later offering a champagne cocktail, I kindly declined as I felt that it was the afternoon tea that had been ruined we were treated differently to others. The positives are that the Wellington lounge is relaxed the staff are friendly. But if you want a proper afternoon tea experience for the same price go to Brown's Langham or the Dorchester. I'm so disappointed as this place was on my hit list."
"We tried this restaurant because we could see the lovely food people were eating. We were not disappointed. It was a chilly day but the seat warmers and feet warmers kept us toasty warm. Friendly knowledgeable servers and flavoursome food, with lots of lovely choices will ensure a return trip. In my opinion nicer than Jamie's Italian."
"This pub is a gem. Tucked away down a quiet road yet very close to Greenwich town centre, this anassuming pub serves great food (and portion sizes!), has an amazing selection of drinks especially if you are into craft beers, has friendly and welcoming staff and ... lets you bring your dogs in! We had the Sunday roast which was excellent and shared a baked Camembert starter which was to die for. Thoroughly recommend."
"First of all, definitely order the spring rolls to start! They were the best part of my meal. The mains here are relatively priced, great size and pretty basic. I would probably almost go as far to say a ""healthy-ish Thai meal"" as it wasn't flooded in lots of sauce and lacked a little salty goodness! The coconut rice was the most disappointing, avoid eating it. Was more bitter than sweet. However, would I eat there again wouldn't go out of my way to recommend. Great for locals to be able to rely on though. Just a stock standard, easy place to get a decent feed. Nothing flashy!"
"We only had coconut cake, cookies and tea here but they were good value! The take away curries looked good and a lot of people were ordering them!"
"Price: 50GBP/ 2Location: Fulham roadDresscode: NonePlease note I am reviewing the original Cafe (not the new restaurant)I don't really know where to start with this one. We lived in Fulham for 3 years and I cannot think of a better place to spend my time. The staff are the friendliest people on the planet, they welcome you with open arms, nothing is too much trouble, as if you are a family member. The small high bar chairs in the tiny space around big wooden tables makes you feel at home in Italy and the atmosphere on Friday night is fantastic. Crowded, everyone laughing and joking, talking and discussing their week. The food is brilliant- from the multiple types of pasta, to the meat balls, the parma ham, the cheese boards and the canoli. I don't know where to start other than to tell you to sample it all. it is all homemade, and i love the mixed pasta plates the cream sauce and the tomato sauce always work well together. Add home baked foccacia, burrata and a bottle of the Montepulciano and you have perfect evening. This is the best place in London/ World for a genuine experience, great food and to meet friends. Sometimes I wish I lived in Fulham still just for this place.We miss you."
"Stopped by early evening on a Saturday, it was really busy and the 2 bar staff were already rushed off their feet, great choice of cocktails on the boards above the bar and we indulged is some new ones that sounded tempting. We got a seat thanks to some friendly patrons and sat back to soak up the retro choice of music and mix of people that were there. We stayed for a couple more drinks, all of which were well put together and left after an enjoyable couple of hours. We stopped by in the middle of the afternoon the day after it was totally empty... this is where the dive status comes in... it's concrete and looks unwelcoming in the cold light of day... but don't let that put you off... we were treated to some more enjoyable, well priced drinks and look forward to going back next time we're in the area."
I come to wasabi at least once a week to pick up a working lunch. Very flavoursome and filling food if you buy a large size. I love the salmon soumen and the sushi. I wish they had more sauce in the salmon teriyaki with rice or a larger salmon soumen option.
"Really impressed by the food at Bar Boulud. Good atmosphere. Although it is not cheap, it is a bit of fresh air in an area of London where resturants tend to be overpriced."
"food variety was interesting and provided a good selection. quality of most food was good as well - highly recommend the quail, steak, monkfish, squid and pig's head in particular. they have a changing menu but have failed to give me an idea of what's on the current menu after multiple attempts of contacting them. service was average. wine selection was small and quality was poor. they provided something called ""orange wines"" which sounded interesting but upon tasting, it tasted sour, so not like your regular wine - not for everybody!"
"A fabulous find for a little bit of France in the heart of London. The best dining experience of my recent visit. From the manager to the busboy, the entire staff couldn't have been kinder or more friendly. My server, Helene was as efficient and attentive as she was charming and lovely. I had the grilled lamb chops with Roquefort dressing on a warm salad of peas, mint and shallots along with frites and a glass of wine. The food was absolutely perfect-and all for under 25 quid! Truly a bargain. The restaurant was bustling, and the atmosphere electric without feeling rushed. The decor matched the service for a truly fine dining experience. It was all I could do not to go back again, but I have a strict policy on dining at a different spot each night. I might have to revise this next time. Top-notch in every way."
"I have eaten here for years and have had many different dishes here and at a huge number of other Curry-houses - nothing else quite matches this place. In addition to the great service & atmosphere, wonderful staff and a lovely owner, this place is absolutely hands-down THE best curry you can get.Perfect for all occasions - and a great takeaway service too!"
"Rules is what I would call a charming restaurant that does and is exactly what it claims. It isn't the best at anything it particular: the decor is full of English heritage and showing signs of age (obvious really since most of it is actually quite old!); the service is good but not outstanding; the food is solid English fair, not haute-cuisine. But you've got to take all of this in the round - the dining experience at Rules is great. The restaurant is charming in its almost shabby-chic way, the food is well above average and the menu has plenty to offer, the waiting staff are immaculately turned out in pristine white aprons and the ambience is marvellous even at lunch. The whole experience make you feel content. Add to that the very reasoable prices for both food and wine and there's nothing not to like. Rules isn't trying to be something that it's not and it's all the better for it. There are some things that are better left as they are.Finally a tip for whisky lovers: I was amazed to find a 1972 Karuizawa on the digestifs menu. Wow!"
I came here two months befor but they were having priveate partyNow I come back for late dinnerAs a matter of fact the grilled sea bass was good even the chips. Service always great with a veryNice staff
"The attraction of this food chain is the fresh ingredients , food to go, wide variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian food and value for money."
"This place is one of my favourite place to eat in London... the food is very good, the location is perfect, the look and feel of the restaurant is amazing and the service from every single member of staff is absolutely spot on!"
"At last... A Pan Asian restaurant/take away in Whetstone high road. My partner went there by chance and ordered a take away, all made fresh on the spot. Great menu choice, cocktails, and dessert. Great value too... Highly recommended."
"A unique experience which you must do on a visit to Kensington. We had an excellent tea very helpful staff, and very friendly we were worried they might be a bit 'superior' as it was such a 'posh' hotel! The only negative was that it boasted the views from Park Terrace of Kensington Garden, which we could not see as our table was at the back of the room, when booking ask for a WINDOW table. Food very excellent sandwiches a dream and cakes to die for. We tried, on our servers recommendation(ask their advice) The Pear and Caramel Tea, a good choice with the sweet cakes scones etc. A must do when in London a very British Institution 'Afternoon Tea'"
"I had a fantastic early lunch in Villa Bianca, one of the tastiest pasta dishes I have had fantastic tomato suace with herbs, ricotta and spinach.Highly recommended."
We were recommended Cote and thought we would give it a go. We were served by the lovely Laura who could not do enough for us and was extremely helpful and understanding of my allergy. The food was excellent and well priced for London and they managed to serve everyone so quickly as it is a great spot before visiting the theatre. We had a wonderful time and would definitely recommend.
"The food was authentic and extremely tasty, especially the tagines - The saddle of lamb and seabass will not disappoint. The service is great with decor to match."
The decor is bizarre and the bar area is too open-great vast spaces missing tables and chairs which on a Saturday should be filled with people. The atmosphere was cold and for a date night it didn't work. We had waiter service and got 2cocktails. It took around 15 minutes for these to come to our table-even though there was no queue at the bar. We were considering getting some food but just weren't inclined to stay and wait even longer.It took so long to get service that after finishing our cocktails (which were tasty and well sized) we paid at the bar. We were charged £2 for service..Not in a hurry to go back.
"Pretentious rip off.Tiny plates of (admittedly ) very tasty food. But huge prices. Poor, slow service, one or two dishes came out at a time, very random. Last dish on its own a bowl of boiled potatoes! Would have been nice to have with the meat. No veggies. All dishes tiny tapas style... you need 3 or 4 per person . Wine very pricey too. Stay in Borough Market and enjoy the street food."
"Last week my wife and I had lunch and then dinner on the same day at Pied a Terre, a restaurant we often visit when staying in London and our on this occasion, our experience is a reminder that even the best establishments can have an off day. For lunch, my wife enjoyed sashimi scollops served with morel mushrooms and accoutrements, beautifully presented with edible flowers etc - gorgeous. I had sweetbreads, pan fried with a hint of cumin etc. This was an absolute delight - the crips sweetbreads were succulently soft and the star of the show - every mouthful was sumptuous. For her main, my wife had venison - perfectly cooked rare/medium with a medley of veg, puree's etc. I had the squab pigeon. Oh my goodness - heaven on a plate for the carniveore. The pigeon breasts were perfectly pan fried rare/medium with seared skin. The small legs were prepared 'confit' and served with slivers of pigeon liver, veg, puree's etc. The flavours and textures combined beautifully - this was close to being one of the best meals I'd ever had! These main events were highlighted with tasty intervals of savoury macaroons, salmon and vichyssoise 'amuse bouche'. Lunch was such a success we were delighted to be returning for dinner - but oh dear - was this the same chef? I don't think so! I started with the sashimi scollops my wife had enjoyed at lunch. The same ingredients, the same flavours, but the presentation was just not there. For our main course we both chose the sea bream. The fish fillets were pan fried, but the skins were barely edible, being soft and chewy. The sauce was over salty and seemed to have a background hint of Thai fish sauce - not pleasant in my book, giveing something of an 'off' smell and taste. This was served with an inedible chunk of undercooked savoy cabbage and inedible flakes of what I imagined were supposed to be crisps of cabbage leaves. These were chewy and only edible with considerable effort -again - not nice. If this had been my first experience of Pied a Terre, that would have been it - never again! This meal too had been given 'amuse bouche' highlights, but I don't recall what we had for dessert as the disaster of the main course had addled my brain. The lunch had been an extatic 10 out of 10, but dinner - probably an agonising 2. What a shame. A meal I'd had a Le Manoir in Oxford 25 years ago still remains top of my leaderboard and this lunchtime meal at Pied a Terre certainly comes in my top 5 - but this presentation of sea bream with cabbage for dinner was awful. Consequently, this review is given 3/5 stars for both meals, but please don't be put off going to this restaurant - almost every other meal we've ever had hear has been lovely."
"My previous experience of Elliot's (great name by the way) was their famous burger from the pop up in the space opposite they had last year. I still rate it as the best burger I have ever eaten.This time my friend and I Arrived at about 7pm on Tuesday with no booking but were offered a seat outside. No burger on the menu for dinner but we chose to order several of the small plates and a carafe of white muscadet. All of the food was delicious but the highlights were the chicken heart (so nice I ordered another portion after!), the sweetbread (which my friend wouldn't normally go near but ate and liked), roasted cod with cockles, the lamb chop and the lovely plump fresh oysters. The bread was also fantastic for soaking up sauces. We were absolutely stuffed by the end of the evening so didn't try desserts.I thought service was pretty good. We had a friendly waitress and the whole experience there was perfectly fine and we had a lovely relaxing evening eating, drinking and chatting. Have already decided I will go again - maybe with a booking, to try the rest of the menu. Not the cheapest at about £55 a head with wine but not bad."
"Very good food. I tried salmon with salad. Sunday roast also looked fabulous. I would love to come back again.It's definitely at the top class pub food.It was very busy. Better to book.Also, the main dishes are between £15 - 20, so not the cheapest in town.But it's worth it."
"We had a fantastic lunch at Rules. The restaurant was tastefully decorated for Christmas. The restaurant was very busy, but that did not affect the service we received. The menu is very traditional, but I chose something a little different in the pheasant curry - absolutely delicious. The crab starter was fantastic.It deserves its reputation. It was a great pleasure to dine in the oldest restaurant in London"
Popped in for lunch. Ordered food at the bar. Food Arrived in reasonable time. Served in a basket.....that you can't cut food up on! Chicken should have been southern fried but was just crumb coated and over cooked shame as looked nice and reasonable portion size.
"Went for lunch with family, and we had the best lamb shish in a very long time.Very caring and friendly, the service also was very good.We will definitely visit again."
"great place, good prices, a block from Grosvenor square. Been there several times over the years and always great service and food for the price."
"Popped in for a cheeky drink after an indian at Tayyabs.The coffee house porter was delicious and the staff friendly, menu looked good but we'd just eaten.Definately worth a visit if you're a beer lover."
"It always surprises me how difficult it is to get a decent brunch in Crouch End, which is obviously full of people who want to eat pretend meals like brunch. Blue Legume is the best place, in my opinion. Decent service, nice food, fairly priced. It's not perfect, but it is pretty good."
"We were a party of three for dinner and pre booked our table via their booking service with no problems at all. We have eaten at this restaurant many times before and have never been dis-satisfied yet. Two of us shared the seafood salad starter as from experience, we knew that the dish is to much for one person. Our friend had the mussels starter and said that they were the best he had ever tasted. For the main courses, I had the dover sole from the specials board,my wife had the breaded veal escallop and our friend had the fried skate wing with capers.All three main meals were wonderful and would thoroughly recommend these dishes to anybody. We still have not exhausted whats on offer on the menu and look forward to returning in the new year to sample another as yet untried dish"
"was wandering with friends on a lazy and cold afternoon for a quick bite and found this amazing place, which was serving even more amazing food at reasonable rates. The ambience was not that great, but the service was very nice, so was the food. I loved the moroccan mint tea..."
"This place was really great. I Arrived with my boyfriend without having made a reservation and we were seated at the bar straight away. It was a Thursday night so reasonably busy but not packed. Drinks were great, we got two each, and the bar men were super helpful. The concept itself was great, as it really was unnoticeable from street level."
"Returned to MK with my kids after some years to this favourite chinese to find the same good quality and service (though the waiters are now mostly young they remain well trained and efficient and even chatty!) The food is top and you can tell by the customers - a lot of asian people locals and visitors.We always start with fried calamari with red chillies, then chinese broccoli and Lobster noodle as main which tastes really diveinely good. And the portions are generous!"
"A very warm welcome, attentive waiter and very good food. The waiter was aware that we had tickets for the opera and produced the welcome drink and then the food at a good pace. It is noisy without any soft-furnishings, but it is fine for a not-too serious evening with friends. The portions are good, the dishes are well-prepared and the creme caramel supreme."
"Right next to More London, this Argentinian restaurant. Meat all over. They show you the differenct cuts to make up your mind, and you can order 225 gr, 300 gr etc. Cooked to perfection. Side orders, sauce all to be ordered seperately. Good winelist, south American oriented, not cheap, count over 125‰âÂ for main courses a glass or wine, some sides and a coffee. For 2.Staff was good, nice and efficient.If you get the right table the view on Tower Bridge is great."
"Five family members ate here on a Friday evening after booking a week ahead. We ordered via the i-pad provided, however the advantage of each diner having a menu and a designated waiter quickly became apparent, as service thereafter was a car-crash. Two drinks took an hour to arrive at the table (including sake). Some dishes and a glass of Malbec never Arrived. Water for the table was apparently unavailable. Desserts only Arrived after we'd waited 30 minutes and asked for the bill (assuming they weren't coming either). The manageress apologised and said that the desserts would be complimentary, but when the bill came they weren't. The service charge wasn't discretionary either so there went another £30 that I'll never see again. At least I had seen it, unlike the pork ribs, the black cod and the Malbec. I'd like to see it again, unlike the waygu-beef burgers, and indeed Inamo Covent Garden."
Pret a Manger is probably one of the best options for having a delicious healthy meal at a very reasonable price. ive had some of the best soups ever and I also loved their salads. And not to forget their coffee which is really good. The restaurants are almost everywhere so it's never difficult to have a healthy diet instead of the traditional fast food restaurants
"Having done no research before hand we decided to play the safe card and came to Jamie's Union Jack.The food was fine with a good choice. Service was excellent, considering it got busier as the evening went on. My companion sitting facing the kitchen was impressed by the speed of work in the kitchen.Avoid the end facing the Opera House as it is where the street buskers go and can be noisy - or you may get to see the worst puppeteer in the world!All in all a hassle free choice before we went on to the theatre."
"We booked the star deal at Tredwells for our third wedding anniversary. It was the perfect meal! The staff were very attentive and bought us a complimentary dessert wishing us a happy anniversary. The food was brilliant with flavours to die for - the crab starter and the steak main were showstoppers for us! The crab starter was immaculately presented with beautiful colours and the flavours really came together. The steak was juicy and tender, perfectly cooked! Definitely one of the best steaks we had ever tried. With options such as the Star Deals, this restaurant is definitely affordable without having to sacrifice quality of food. We will definitely be visiting again in the near future."
"The food has been excellent been using for 4 years as a local restaurant when you want a good meal, great variety always fresh its very clean, the only drawback is sometime the staff can be a little 'not rude' but shall we say lack understanding which can be frustrating. The prices are very reasonable excellent value for what you are getting. The Sea Bass was beautiful just done the way I love it. The Spare Ribs are great as is the Chicken Satay.Easy to get to by public transport or by car will continue to use as long as it is there."
"It's a great burger kitchen with lots of varieties of burgers. We're regulars of the place and love it a lot.My boyfriend always gets the camemberger (camembert and skinny fries inside) while I'm partial to the chicken satay and Californian burger. Their sweet potato fries and elderflower fizz are also favorites of ours.One thing to watch out for is that the burgers do not come with fries. Those have to be ordered on the side. If you visit often you can also get some good discounts if you download the GBK app.Service is usually quick and friendly. The place tends to be noisy and crowded on the weekends, which is not surprising given that it's on Portobello Road. It's also a self service restaurant in that you seat yourself and order from the front - then the food gets brought out to you.Not the best burger joint ive ever been too, but it's pretty good."
"Very cool place, nice location, pleasant staff and delicious food, additionally cool interior and cozy seatings - what else do you need?"
"We had a great time fantastic service,fantastic food,special thanks to all the staff especially Daniel&Johan for making our night for our annivesary we'll come back again with our friend and family."
Our 1st time to this establishment. The server was SO rude to us due to not knowing how the menu worked. The food was great but hey learn some customer service skills. I don't think I will return due to the poor service
"As always great food at one of my favourite eateries. Although the place was very busy we did not encounter any issues, the food was very hot upon arriveal at the table and the service was second to none !!"
"A real proper ship on the Thames with good food, great service and unique surroundings. I loved it. The crab was super and the bill moderate. Tidal flow impacts the level of steepness of the ramp on and off but no biggie."
"I loved the whole ambience of this place, it is a little gem tucked away in a corner of Kings Cross. The food was great, every course was a work of art and tasted wonderful. I have seen some reviews which say that the food has no flavour, I can't understand this as every mouthful was packed with flavour. The lovely waitress was attentive, but not overly so, and I can't wait to go back."
i love that food!!! the moster burger is perfect... ^.^ very busy every day but comfortable. i want to come back very soon.. :)
"When I booked hotel for London, read hotel reviews! One review mentioned that Pret A Manger was around the corner! So glad! Have enjoyed Pret A Manger in different locales! As usual, I enjoyed my pastry or porridge! Coffee filtered was good!"
"This place is headed in basement of luxury mandarin hotel, the place is very big and have a lovely atmpshere and very vibrant.Food was not the best but ok, unfornaly the served a really awful fois gras, they mixed sweat bread and fois gras it tasted really bad, the pasta with lamb was aout of flavour, the meat we had was very good. sevice was great Prices are very good aswell.Ps have a drink in the stylish bar at mandarin hotel before dinner."
"Got a 20% off voucher in John Lewis and I was hungry so I decided to give Rossopomodoro a try. It took ages before my waitress came to take my order but my pizza Arrived really quickly. I was immediately disappointed because it had no tomato sauce (Limone e Acciughe). I did check the menu later and I had failed to notice that tomato sauce wasn't listed as an ingredient having mistakenly assumed it would be there. The pizza had a thick layer of cheese which was cold, rubbery & unpleasant to eat so I scraped it off (sadly no molten cheesy strings of a normal pizza). The middle 50% of the pizza was very wet & the dough saturated & so sloppy that I had scoop it up with my fork. I was hungry so I ate it anyway but gave up about a third of the way when I came across a large part of the base that was charred and inedible as a result. My waitress, despite wafting by several times, did not stop to collect my plate (despite my knife and fork being put together and plate pushed away). Another server noticed my plate and asked why I hadn't eaten the pizza. I was offered a free hot drink to compensate. That took ages to arrive but was nice. I was too embarrassed to complain (so British!) and paid the bill without complaining. I wish I hadn't stopped there for lunch."
This was my 2nd visit with my better half......here again for afternoon tea. Meet and greet was good: smooth and painless (as it should be). Had a v nice table and initial service was lovely. 1st issues were when the food and tea Arrived. The (bread) finger sandwiches made with white bread was less than fresh and equally criminal for an afternoon tea....both tea pots were not hot. One other v slight moan: it took an age to get a small enough spoon to eat one of the desserts served. Positives: the content of the sandwiches and the scones/cakes were v yummy. Just tiny attention to detail spoilt this occasion. I know what you're thinking: why not send the offending things back? We do have an aversion to returning items to the kitchen as we fear what added ingredients might be additions to the original. Paranoia I know but there it is. The freedom of choice as to who to give your hard earned £££ to.
"Booked here as part of a deal with Love Theatre. After booking this we realised that this meant we had an extremely limited menu, but it contained several staples such as pizza and carbonara so weren't too concerned Arrived and shown to an extremely indifferent table. Starter was a sort garlic bread which turned out to be bits of bread to dip in a sort of garlicky sauce. Very bland. Then had carbonara which was a large portion, but with the approximate taste and consistency of wallpaper paste. All in all, most unappetising and I would not go back. NB. It is possible there are nicer dishes on the menu but they are not available under the limited Love Theatre offer."
"If you're a noodle lover, you have to try it with Beer but you have to wait, we were lucky that we were able to sit in 5 minutes but other persons were waiting for so long.."
"I had the misfortune to find myself in the Kensington branch of this chain. The menu states that some dishes are vegetarian, yet all hot dishes contain oyster sauce. They refused to change egg noodles to rice noodles in the chow mein and admitted that it wasn't really suitable for 'strict' vegetarians anyway. Why deceive vegetarians who order and eat these dishes? Where's the integrity in calling dishes vegetarian and not really meaning it? I suppose they are happy to take our money, but are seemingly seriously unconcerned about the contents of their food. Vegetarians and vegans should avoid at all costs. Even carniveores should beware; the staff are pretty clueless about what their dishes actually contain."
"My partner and I used to visit this restaurant on a regular basis, about 20 years ago, when we lived in London. It was one of our favourite restaurants in London at that time and we have such fond memories of the place. We took our teenage children and 3 friends there two nights again and it was one of the most unpleasant restaurant experiences I have ever had. Service as other reviewers have mentioned was incredibly slow, even though there appeared to be plenty of staff milling around. We weren't so bothered by this but were really shocked by what followed. We were brought bottles of wine that we hadn't ordered and of the three we didn't order one of the waiters opened one of them. We had said we didn't want them before this and when we repeated this after they were opened he said we would have to pay as it had been opened. They then insisted that we also had to pay for the other two, as well, even though they had not even been opened. We tried to discuss this with them and one of the waiters became very verbally aggressive, pointing his finger at us, shouting and saying 'I am not a liar, but you sir.....' pointing at one of our group. This went on and on and we ended up having to pay for more than we actually drank-one of our group just wanted to get us out of the place. We left without ordering food and will never ever go back there again. If I was the owner of this restaurant I would be doing something about certain members of your staff. (One of the other waiters did apologise to us on the way out). We had other friends eating there that night as well, as we were all attending an event at Olympia, and they said that when it came to paying their bill they were charged for things they hadn't had as well. I feel really sad that my fond memories, of what once was a great restaurant, have been tarnished. A horrible experience!"
"An Australian friend recommended the place as a romantic place with good food and even though Jamie Oliver places were getting bad reviews in the press I wanted to see for myself. We went there last night at 9:30 on a wednesday, the place was almost empty 4 tables of people hanging out. Reception was friendly waitress was a bit what you would expect pretty and aloof but she turned out to also be a good waitress left alone a bit but not too much and no dribble about the food or restaurant, she just let us get on with it.My husband had liver and bubble and squeak I had pork chop and vegetables, the greens were cooked lightly and fresh, the gravy was nice, the price was cheap. Nice comfort food, with fresh herbs and nicely cooked. I think it suits most tastes but nothing elaborate no sauces or difficult food. The wine was average (my only complaint) so careful on what you choose. We had each a main (no starter) a glass of wine and one side we shared, so a very light meal. Our friends had the pizzaUK bread things and said they were really nice, but the menu is quite extensive with fish and meat so a good variety of choice.The crowd is mixed young professionals, young hip and middle aged locals neighborly type, a bit of everything. This was a great quick meal we agreed we could eat there twice a week when you do not feel like cooking, or if you want an evening out that is civeilised and relaxed. It was so easy and pleasant perfect for a simple quiet evening out with a decent meal. It cost 35£. If you take a starter and a dessert it will cost round 50£ for 2."
Well this place is amazing they sDo the best pies in england by a country mile great friendly atmosphere and the food is out of this world have eaten here 3times and everytime the food is one of the best meals ive had very good prices aswell and always served with a smile if you go here dont forget to try the pies
"We visited St Katharine Docks after a day out at the Tower of London with our daughter in law. We needed somewhere to eat and liked the location. However, the service we experienced at Strada was unexpectedly great. The waiter - I wish I had taken his name - was a joy and a great laugh. My wife and daughter in law especially loved him, but the service was genuinely special. It's people like him who make people like us come back for more. Well done, that man!"
"We went on an offer and perhaps you only ever get what you pay for. To be fair, the atmosphere, ambience, decor and making you feel comfortable were all really good, hence my 3 star rating. However, the food let it down in my opinion. We both went for the lobster burger (which I had REALLY been looking forward to) but it didn't bear any resemlance to lobster and I was extremely disappointed. I would have preferred a fish finger sandwich.Anyway, top marks for the starter (goats cheese salad with a honey dressing, couldn't taste the truffle oil though).Disappointing on the food front but when balanced with what we paid it was OK; I just wouldn't recommend the lobster burger to my worst enemy."
"Went for a late afternoon pre-cinema burger. Really in the mood for one. When I went to order was told they had run out of beef burgers after having a capital beef burger special pushed to us. Totally unacceptable for what is, after all, a burger kitchen.Was unapologetically offered a chicken burger - seriously?"
Booked table downstairs.Small dishes good for sharing.We quite easy going so let son and girlfriend order a selection as we eat most foods and not frightened to experiment.Probably not enough veg or fish choice as we love all types.Had the crispy cabbage though.Tried the famous buns.Had the blackened cod. A fun evening with attentive staff even though busy.The recommended Chenin Blanc was a great accompaniment .
Really good and tasty food. I recommend vegetarian number 6 and the roti number 1. Only bad thing is it can be a little greasy.
"Lovely hotel but service in bar and restaurant was so bad that we will not be returning with clients or for pleasure. Staff was rude. Prior to arriveing received email from hotel asking if we needed to reserve tables in bar or restaurant. Upon arriveing and going to bar the story changed and we were told they don't reserve tables in the bar. Interesting as there were ""reserved"" signs on tables! Will not be returning!"
"Expensive and bland fish and chips that in no way compare to other local establishments. I would give the restaurant an average, but it's hard to justify £15.95 for just okay fish. Perhaps the price is this high due to the bottomless chips but are bottomless chips really necessary? Poor beer selection and boring interior. I smelled like fried fish when I left. Service was fine and the food Arrived in a reasonable timeframe. Overall, there are just too many MUCH better options out there. Try The Portman or the Truscott Arms."
"We went to The Strada at St Catherine's Dock for a New Years Eve meal. The set menu for £35/ head had a good selection and came with a free glass of Prosecu. The welcome, service and general ambience was very good and complemented a good standard of food delivered efficiently. We will definitely use this chain again."
Overall a good experience. Took an American friend as this would be a treat for them to experience England in a more traditional way. Easy to reserve in advance and service overall quite food.
The decor is charming and appears somewhat random but in the sneaky way that it is very carefully planned to look just so. Tables are placed close together and the noise level can get rather high but it doesn't really matter that much. The food is simple and tasty which happens to be my favorite kind of food. All items on the menu are small sample portions and thus an array of food is required but also very much a part of the experience. Prices are very fair and wine can be ordered by the glass. I will definitely be back!
"Sonia was lovely and very attentive, her recommendations were great. I ordered the guacamole which was made at the table and very tasty! The crab tostades were lovely. Would definitely recommend!"
"I visited this resaurant recently before a visit to the theatre. It was busy but they managed to fit us in. The menu wasnt very vegetarian friendly, but managed to find something to eat. The food I had was tasty, but nothing special. I thought the food was overpriced. The staff were ok,but not especially friendly. I probably wouldnt visit again"
"I went for Sunday lunch with a friend, I had booked and checked that I would be OK to bring my dog. When we got there our table was set and a dish with a few dog treats had been left on the table with a bowl under the table. Happy dog & happy human! The roast was nice and the staff helpful. Would go again!"
"Good solid menu here with meat, fish and veggie dishes. ive always loved the atmosphere, particularly in the early evening. There are always different proper ales on, a good choice of (pricy) wine, and a choice of nice corners to sit on the old furniture - very relaxed place. However, in the evenings it can get completely packed and very noisy, particularly if the main space is booked for a party (it's not very separate). It's also a football pub, with big screens but on some of the nights ive been there (I'm not a fan) ive actually got quite into watching it. Lovely staff. Dog friendly, which has always been a big plus for us. They'll bring your dog a bowl of water. No dogs in the restaurant part which is set aside, but you can still eat in the bar and get the benefit of the full menu."
"Top marks. Arrived mid afternoon place was busy but staff kept us up to date with waiting times. Great food, top quality. Great atmosphere and even though its small and busy you didn't feel rushed. Staff were polite and really efficient. Had a great meal so had no qualms leaving a tip, waiter thanked me for the tip and seemed really pleased, genuinely pleased i'd enjoyed my visit. I left a bag at the table and he came out to find us, no easy task in a heaving oxford street! Got me out of trouble with the other half!"
"They find a way to charge extra, un clearly advised what its included what its extra they charge servis cost and they don't listen complain about wrong advise, they charge for water £4 for bottles, generally do not recommend for lunch"
"We had lunch in this restaurant a few days ago. My family and I are fans of J,O.«s cooking long time ago. That said, we felt a bit disappointed after our visit.The staff was friendly, but just on the average,and the location was... well, Convent Garden. Our disappoinment had to do with the food. A bunch of watercrest leaves with no dressing (or soul...) can hardly be called a ""watercrest salad"". And there was a bit too much of chili on every dish we ordered. To sum up, we thought the price was more related with the location than with the quality of th food. Overpriced. Disappointing."
"As an extended family we go to the Gurkhas very often , perhaps twice a month .The food there is exceptional always . The staff are second to none . They are fantastic company and very attentive . We have used this restaurant pretty much from the opening & quality has always remained . My father lives in the road opposite ( Bob ) . I might recommend that you book , sometimes it hard to get a table . Fantastic place ."
I loved the fact that everything was easily accessible. The staff were friendly and helpful.
"One of my favourite spots for a modern brunch. I was well behaved (for once) and skipped the Bloody Mary. The coffee was worth it though. A scrummy flat white.He went for the chorizo with a side of morcilla. I had the greens. Both served on a toasted ciabatta (I of course brought my own cause of the wheat allergy, but they happily accommodate) and a portion of scrambled eggs. Friendly service as ever. A relaxed informal venue."
The food was nice here with a nice atmosphere. They had seat warmers which were necessary on a cold winters day. The service was very good and it did not take long for the food to come.
"Went with a large group for a friends birthday with no knowledge of this place and was pleasantly surprised. The food was interesting (i don't like oysters so didn't indulge), the drinks were mixed well and staff were really attentive - I really enjoyed the relaxed bistro style atmosphere though did slightly miss the mad kitsch of the previous tenants LMNT the food is about 200% better."
"Food was out of this world, very tasty, beautifully presented as you would expect from Marco's restaurant, highly recommend"
"We went as bunch of 15-16 friends and ordered almost everything on the menu. Food was yumm to taste. The quantity is huge! You can literally share one dish among two of you if you are also ordering starters to go with it, The only thing, which they should improve is customer toilets. We used it and it was Pathetic. Infact we feel there is no customer toilets and we were directed towards staff's toilet room since so many of us needed to use it."
"On my way back from a trip to Kenya I picked Pret for some food to go on my return to Minnesota and I wasn't able to eat it until I got home 12 hours later, but it was outstanding. I had the no bread crayfish salad and the best salad I have had in a long time. Also had the prawn salmon sushi, a BLT sandwich and a mince pie and all were excellent. I just we had a Pret here someplace in the Midwest.So I guess it just blew me away that airport fare could be so good and fresh, and I have to commend the company for a job well done. I know it will be my first choice if traveling to places where a Pret might be located."
This was a major discovery. We ordered both grilled fish as well as battered fish and chips. Both by far the best we've had in London in a long time. Served with impeccable chips/fries (NOT greasy in the least) and superb service. Also the desert (apple cake) was excellent. Very pleasant atmosphere.
"Yesterday night we had a quick dinner with my friend. Food was just simply amazing, especially Venison(everyone have to try it!) and service was above my expectations, members of staff was very friendly and helpful too choose a meal! 5 stars goes to Busaba, i will definitely come back!"
"I really like the setting of the restaurant and the staff we friendly and efficient.I had the superfood salad, it was ok, but it was very small. I ordered chicken with the salad and expected chicken breast, but instead I got a tiny amount of dark chicken meat. I would try the restautant again, but I wouldn't order the salad again."
"We visited on a Saturday morning. It was easy to find and to book online and worked well. Across the road from Borough Market there is great atmosphere with a friendly service and a regular crowd with a lively vibe. On a cold May day there was a cheering log stove.We went for the market feast breakfast which while not cheap at £17.50 was an interesting take, With the best toast I have ever tasted, home made baked beans, and quality ingredients and 2 eggs each. Unlimited apple juice topped it off together with great coffee.The alternative to this feast is the equivealent of a ""full English"" which is £10 but the toast, coffee etc. is then extra. We loved the place, it had character. The only negatives are the slightly small tables with insufficient room for all the dishes, the hard wooden seats school style, and the window bench which is not only too hard, too narrow but there's a cold draft running underneath from the window, the cold of which is pressed right against your back. Would we go back? Yes we would but we'd try to get more room around the big table, even if sharing"
"popped in for drinks and a snack over new year, average prices for sandwiches etc but decent service and great coffee and hot chocolate."
"After seeing the clippers come home from the round the word voyage my wife, 3 daughters and I decided to have a meal before leaving the marina. The place was very busy but there was a table out side of Strada. After sitting there for a couple of minutes we found out why it was free. It was a hot day already but the hot air coming from next doors air con was unbearable. We asked for a table inside which we got but when we asked for a high chair for our 2 year old we were informed they don't have any( funny when they have a children's menu) We made do with a chair so 5 of us sat round a table for 4. Fair enough they got us in. After ordering starters and mains we waited and the starters Arrived but we had to ask for the sauce to go with the children's starter where the waitress looked at us with a blank face just showing she did not know the menu. Sauce Arrived with shortly followed by the main course while we were still half way through the starters. The food was squeezed on to the table with no apologies. The garlic bread I had to eat was so over cooked it snapped as I bit it and when we complained about the lack of soap and toilet paper in the toilets to top it all off the manager just said it was because they were busy but as we turned around half the restaurant was empty. The only saving grace of the restaurant was they did not charge us for any of the meal which I would have been reluctant to pay but would have as I don't expect to get something for nothing. Needless to say I won't be going back and to top it all off I was ill later that night but can not say this was from eating the food."
"The waiter clearly wanted to seat us by the window even if we asked for a sofa table, so that was not a good start. He was although very friendly and did a good job. The waitress who took the order did not speak very well English so there was some misunderstanding that lead to that we ordered too much food. The dim sums came three of each kind if anyone wonders. The bang bang chicken salad was lovely and the children loved their chicken noodles."
"We went to union jacks for our second visit at my daughters request. Again the restaurant was busy and we had to wait for a table but it was only about 15 mins for a table for 5. The food as you would expect was lovely ( we had pizzas & fish & chips ) at a good price. The only slight let down was the wait for drinks, as I think we were forgotten about. That said next time in London we will return to here if I can't convince my girls to try the Italian in the old part of the market."
"We were here for a birthday dinner and oh boy was this the best place for a celebration. The staff greet you upon arriveal, super attentive, smiles all around. The restaurant was buzzing. Quite a glamorous feel, great decor. All that from just 2mins into the experience :-) Very accommodating staff. Attentive to the very end. Food was to die for. The steaks are the stars of the show. This is where you go when you want good steak. :-) All in all, one of the best restaurant experiences we have had."
"We dined at Sea Shell Restaurant in Lisson Grove this past Good Friday while visiting London. We were a large group of family and friends and we had a splendid time. The Cod fish with chips was a huge hit. The portions were huge. What a combination: great food, great atmosphere, great company, great service and most of all great prices.The desserts were amazing. I tried spotted dick with a warm custard and it immediately became one of my favorite desserts. Be sure to check out Sea Shell for the most amazing fish and chips in London."
"Visited on a Saturday evening - pre-booked a table. Very lively place with a good atmosphere. Seated at a good table - there was 9 of us so we were rather a large group. Food was ordered and delivered to the table quickly. Well presented and hot food. We had a variety of food off the menu and all of the party enjoyed their meals. Our waiter Mikey was very attentive and had a great rapport with the customers. The only downside was that we were sat by a group of extremely loud and annoying girls, who were that noisy you couldn't hear yourself speak, we asked to move tables and that was sorted without a problem. The management had to speak to these indiveiduals on a number of occasions and I have to stay that the lady manager dealt with them brilliantly and very professionally and eventually they did calm down. We were celebrating 2 birthdays and the waiters came to our table with cake and sang to them. A great night was had by all lovely food and good service, well done TGI's"
"We visited the Park Terrace for the third time a few days ago and once again had a truly fantastic meal. The menu is varied and encompasses old favorites, such as the Black Beef starter and the warm raspberry tart dessert. The barman made a mean cocktail, I had a non-alcoholic mojito and my husband had a 500 mile, both of which were excellent. Our meals were both top quality, very tasty and beautifully presented. The staff seemed to have all changed since our visit some months ago. but were all most professional,courteous, helpful and unobtrusive. We heartily recommend that you visit the Park Terrace restaurant, you will not be disappointed."
"Took me some time to write this as it deserved my full attention, but here it goes. I visited this restaurant last week with my wife and three kids. This consists of my two girls and eldest son. It was a Friday, and there was clearly an excited atmosphere around the place. Perhaps this added to why staff were distracted about themselves, but this does not excuse their lack of acknowledgment. We stood by the door for 3 minutes before being greeted, and it then took some time to sit us down as there was confusion with our reserved table. Their answer to this was to sit us on someone's else's reserved table for the meantime. Drinks came by pretty fast, but the food did take some time to arrive. What really made our visit unpleasant and very uncomfortable at times was a managers blatant flirtatious attention towards my son. The man was clearly gay, which isn't the issue, but his behaviour was not professional at all! Our attempt to defuse the situation was to politely smile at his comments when taking our orders but this only encouraged his behaviour further to our shock. You can't miss him when visiting as he has a loud nature about him, this was clear as we heard him comment on other male customers e.g. ""Ooo sexy"". Constant arguments amongst staff also. I felt like I was in the middle of a family argument. It's a shame that this review is solely based on a member of staff, but his actions definitely affected the taste of my dish. I'd definitely not come back and will inform others on this too."
"ive eaten here a few times with work friends. I would go back - but this is one of those restaurants where the quality of your meal depends on what you order.On my last visit everyone was disappointed except me. For starter, we shared a selection of dim sum - some plates were delicious and some were average or even weird tasting.For main, I had KOONG PHAD TAOSEE which is prawns topped with black bean sauce. This was really delicious and I'm glad ive found a safe dish I can go back to. Some dishes are unnecessarily spicy so I recommend you state your preference when ordering if you can't eat food that's too spicy. They are happy to cater for this so certainly a plus."
"They used to do delivery in the area but no longer. Some of the a la carte dishes are quite good including the beef rendang, nasi goreng, sambal udang (prawn). The curries are more of a miss. The set menu in the cafe is good value but not especially great. Nice cheap place for a quick Malaysian bite, though unless you're skinned I'd stay away from the set."
me and my fiancee went here just for a cocktail to start with which was really nice.. then we decided to have dinner which was fantastic perfectly cooked we ended up spending the rest of the evening there because the service was that good and you are made to feel so welcome all in all i would highly recomend it... :)
Visited London over Easter school break. Tried this pub for food. Drinks order taken at table and delivered to table which was nice touch. Wine very very expensive per glass! Food very average. Fish cake dry with undressed plain lettuce as salad and nothing else! Sausage and mash tasted like smash and sausages cheap. Fish and chips OK. Chicken burger average. It seemed food was prepared upstairs and sent down in dumb waiter for chap downstairs to serve. Over priced and definitely not a gastro experience. Shame as staff waiting our table were pleasant but let down by average food.
they were really nice and change or food because we made the wrong decision. also the food was incredible. A real Japanese ramen restaurant.
"We went to Cote before going to the Ballet at the Coliseum. We had booked as it was just before christmas and this was essential as a lot of people were turned away, as the restaurant was full.We chose from the lunch time pre-theatre menu, which was very reasonable and still had plenty of choice. The staff were very attentive and friendly, even though every table was taken. They also made a fuss of my 5 year old, which was lovely as it was a real London treat for her.I would say that Cote is ideally located, the food is good and reasonable and we had no issues with being made to 'hurry up', even though as I say, they were full and we were having the pre-theatre menu. I would recommend it to anyone for this type of dining."
"Restaurant DesignedEvery time we went past we saw that it was fullThis restaurant steak loversI took the packet to New YorkAlso picked mushrooms, onion rings, calamari, and a children's menuAll dishes were goodPrice is a bit high"
"I went there yesterday around 3pm when there were only about a dozen people in the restaurant so being busy was not an excuse for almost no service. The food was ok but just kind of slapped on the plate without any care. With London not having a shortage of wonderful places to eat, you can do better than eat here."
I was recently in London and ate at several different pret a manger. Great service inexpensive food. Clean and twice I was given a free item. One coffee and once a cookie. Just telling me to have a good day !!!!
"Bought the steak dinner and wine deal through Wowcher and had a really nice evening.Staff were great and food was excellent. I wondered what wine we would get having only paid £29 for two for this but it was great. I have been on a few of these Wowcher, Groupon etc deals and this was by far the best we have been on, looking to book the afternoon tea with champagne now, great stuff."
Very classy little chip shop. Clean and shiny. Proper chip shop chips. Homemade pies. Excellent fish. Not very cheap but well worth it
"I first came here with a group of friends a few days after it opened under new ownership and it was brilliant. Months later....frankly a disappointment and not really worth the visit. The portions were tiny TINY. I had the tuna which was a very small steak, cut into half to make very thin steaks. I had to have some chicken at home! And oh yes, empty tables that they wouldn't seat you at as they were 'booked'."
"Used the app Where chefs eat to find this place in busy Borough Market. No problems to get a table for two for lunch without reservation close to opening but an hour later it was full. Relaxed atmosphere but very knowledgeable staff that gave great recommendations regarding food, wine and beer. Since the menue shifts a couple of times a day just go ahead and try stuff you never had before. We had orange wine, smoked heart and a long baked goat for the first time."
"We booked our reservation through top table which we were very impressed by and all went smoothly. We Arrived at 7.15 and were informed that our table was outside and that we wernt allowed to switch with another table as the computer sets where you sit, despite their being plenty of other spaces inside & out. Eventually we settled for a space they cleared along the side of the room. It's took a good 15 mins for them to even lay the plates, knives and forks. We ordered two starters, which were both extremely enjoyable. We then ordered two more dishes out of the 'large plate' selection. When they eventually Arrived they were almost certainly no larger than the starter plates for twice the cost. We enjoyed them both although the gnocchi dish could have been better balanced ingredients wise. It was then when we finished our mains that the service seemed to completely disappear! No one was taking any notice of us, when we finally grabbed someone's attention we asked them for a dessert menu and we watched them as they almost immediaty started doing something else and ignored out request. We spent the next 10 minuites trying to grab their attention again having at this point decided to ask for the bill, alas still no sign of our waitress, we nearly walked out without paying, I doubt they would have noticed. Eventually we made payment took by front of house who was clearly in a rush and didn't even bother to say thank you or ask us how our meal was...a disappointing end to our experience. Would like to come here again for the food but not worth the risk of being ignored by the staff!"
Great food at a reasonable price. We had to wait 20 minutes for a table which wasn't a problem as we had a drink at the bar. Very busy and a bit noisy but nice staff and good food.
"Nice restaurant with good food 2 years ago, now is commercial with nothing good: tea - made in the morning and served all day as fresh tea! Thai calamari - very dry with no taste at all! Pad Thai - worst. Avoid them."
Great service - diligent in finding gluten free options. Interesting combinations of flavours including a delicious cheeseburger taco.
"In these days of mass market, mega restaurants giveing you an iPad to order yourself and bringing food that was just heated and served after arriveing frozen from some distant commissary, it is refreshing to visit an authentic and traditional restaurant hundreds of years old and operating similar to the way it did back then. There are career waiters who are well trained, know what they are doing, can actually answer a question about the menu correctly and care about exemplary service. The food is all fresh, well prepared and presented. The sections are tradition which is good. The drinks are also as ordered and not given to you in a glass chock to the brim with ice as we do in the USA. Overall, would I return? Of course. Would I recommend it? Reluctantly as I don't want the secret out hehe. Enjoy. Bon Appetite."
"Yes you really DON'T need chorizo in a cocktail but there are plenty of great original drinks to be had upstairs. It's dark, intimate and loud, but loads of fun and the service is excellent."
"Stumbled on Belushi's in Covent Garden after passing top end restaurants and kind and not wanting to that kind of full on service. We were walking off out of covent garden and thinking somewhere on the on the Strand may be useful. Then we saw this little kookie place, peeped in the window and saw seats available. Sad thing was the seating was all high stools! Well, ok for long legged people but not so hot for those a little shorter! Still I liked it in there once balanced. Atmosphere was funky, a little dark (nice) and calm. Waiter found us straight away and drinks ordered, minutes later we put in food order. I had a chicken caesar salad and best fries! and my partner had a wicked burger, stacked! There was no rush and we felt we were not in the way. I really enjoyed it in there, chilled out and unlike the humdrum of Covent Garden it was a groovy lunch. Would we go back? Damn right we would!"
"Was bought a Groupon gift to visit the Ice Bar, and had a most enjoyable time there. Awesome actual Ice Bar, good for pictures, music and cocktails! Had an equally awesome cocktail (Crumble) in the warm bar upstairs afterwards. Watched the ice carvers at work, carving Gorilla heads. Service was good and friendly, nothing but a most enjoyable experience."
"We were recommended to visit to try our first sourdough pizza. Our first impressions were of a smart, clean, vibrant restaurant which was in a convenient location in Ealing. The service was great, the menu choices catered well for our party of four, which included vegetarians and vegans. Our pizzas were perfect! the prices were reasonable and we can't wait to visit again. Thank you!"
ive been here about 5 times and this hands down the best cocktails ive had in London. What is so appealing about this place is that the hostess and bar staff really care about making this the best experience possible for you. The cocktails are incredibly creative and they will happily have a discussion about your preferences to find something right for you. The decor is dark and candle lit which is very conducive to enjoying fine cocktails and good conversation. One thing to bear in mind is that its not a big bar and if you don't book there is a good chance you won't get a table especially if its on a Thurs to Sat night.
"The first thing you will be greeted by, is the friendly, smiley faces of the staff. The ambience is perfect, the only downside for me is the huge tables that can sit about 8 people, so if it is crowded you might find yourself in unholy matrimony, or flat sharing with 6/7 random people. We were quite lucky, we got a table for two, but it meant we were not facing each other.The food was reasonably priced and delectable, I enjoyed ever morsel and every mouthful. I ordered starters and a main and was not disappointed at all.I would love to go back there again."
"Lovely setting; ambience. Very welcoming staff especially our server, Darius, whose enthusiasm and eagerness to please saved the night from falling apart. Two attempts to present rib-eye steaks for my son and myself indicated the kitchen was not firing - all Arrived cold and, appallingly, on stone-cold plates. Darius kept us smiling and he was genuinely upset; and the cost was erased from the bill plus a complimentary bottle of wine provided. Still the other mains were only acceptable at best, certainly not special, and the deserts lacked imagination. You could not fault the reaction of the staff and one hopes this was simply a night when the kitchen lost its way. Shame."
"This is a nice pub to leave close to. It's a little bourgeoisie and tends to fill up with suits, but has some decent beer and is definitely a lovely place to spend a few hours."
"It was my son's choice of restaurant before seeing Charlie and Chocolate Factory. I have genuinely enjoyed many trips to TGI restaurants but this was not one of them. Pre booked and given a squeezed in table where we were then forgotten about, including part of our order. My meal was 'prepared' well in advance and just assembled. Tortilla and rice revolting.I would visit a TGI again but never this one. This is the second time it has happened at this branch. I should have learnt my lesson the last time."
"Needed Restaurant near the Albert Hall for evening meal, found this one online,as we were traveling up from Herne Kent booked a table for four and crossed our fingers.We were not disappointed great welcome by very friendly staff . Italian dishes very tastyunlike bland food served up by most big name chain restaurants. Restaurant very cosyas room at as at premium but for our party loved the vibrant atmosphere, fantastic service and will certainly return when in this area again. well done all at Pierino."
"I am a Pizza Express regular - we've used them as a family for years.This one is on the junction of Baker St and Euston Road and the surroundings feel a bit touristy especially on a warm summer's evening in June. And so I was expecting a pressured experience and some consternation that I was eating solo. Not a bit of it - I had a choice of sitting outside, inside or downstairs. My waiter was quick, friendly and attentive and had the skill of leaving me alone to enjoy my meal but being available to catch his eye when I needed something else. The food quality was good as usual and the ambience was a busy hum. Really enjoyed my time (I had mozarrella and tomato salad, American Hot Pizza and the coconut Premio Gelato (recommended)"
"A great catch-up lunch with a friend as between us, after ordering a glass each of their excellent Pinot Grigio Danzante, we enjoyed a mushroom risotto and a delicious creamy, salmon tagliatelle. There was a good choice of desserts. The vanilla and chocolate ice cream was perfect for me, however my companion, though liking the texture of her panna cotta al mirtillo, thought the flavour a little weak.The staff looking after us were very friendly and helpful, pacing the meal just right. They were there if we needed something but didn't rush us. I will certainly return."
"This is a wonderful place for Fish & Chips. We had a salab with prawns and avocado, calamari and cod with chips. We recommend all the dishes. All the fried goods were light and fresh, fully fried just before serving in good cooking oil. The portions were plentiful and the chips were ""bottomless"" ie you could get second helpings without extra charge. The restaurant works with both sit in and take away sections, that are separate. The sitting area is pleasantly decorated and does not smell heavily of fried fish."
"A quirky idea for a restaurant to allow you to choose your food and order it through an ipad. It seems as though this DIY element has caused the staff to view their role as unimportant and therefore they don't really bother with making an effort to be polite.'You have to have freed up your table in an hour and a half' even though we'd Arrived early for a booking and the restaurant was empty.'You have to order from the a large a carte' when we'd booked for the fixed price menu.It all just lacked a little friendliness. When the bill came the 'optional' service had been added on, normally not an issue, but bearing in mind the only service was staff placing the food on our table whenever it was ready and every other interaction was clipped and off putting we were a bit annoyed. Not annoyed enough to ask to ask for it to be taken off before paying on our card however!Overall, the food was OK, but not as special as the prices lead you to believe and the interactive games on the table 'to amuse you while you wait' are a bit out of date and clunky...and with only an hour and a half to order, eat and pay l'm not sure when you'll get chance to try them out anyway.£79 for 2 starters and 2 average priced mains and 2 small glasses of the cheapest wine."
"We'd heard about this place and had our first visit today. Breakfast. I'm not usually a huge fan but this was amazing! I think Stephane cooks scrambled eggs better than anyone else on the planet! Really friendly, and the service relaxed but efficient. A great start to the day. Thank you Stephane and Maicin."
"my favourite lunchtime spot! just off Charlotte Street, LondonFab food and I'm never disappointed, fast service which is great when you only have 1 hour for lunch, beautiful thai style decor although small in space size I think this place has character and also popularwe always go for the lunch time menu which is great value for money, the choice as always comes from Green, Red or yes Yellow Curry, Noodles and more!Give the Panang Curry a good its delish!"
"Had afternoon tea with unlimited prosecco. We were seated upstairs and our waitress explained the food and was on hand for most of the time with the prosecco although the staff were conspicuous by their absence for a while. Sandwiches were lovely, as were the scones, and the chocolate brownie was, according to one of us, 'a little bit of heaven'. Good value for an afternoon tea in Covent Garden"
"Visited the takeaway recently (there is also a restaurant). The battered cod was tasty and a good portion size. The chips were less than ordinary. The portion size was big (even for a regular size) but there was little to no flavour. Have eaten in the restaurant before and liked it. This time, not so much."
Really loved that place all over London or Scotland. . As it serves variety of sandwiches soups dessert and juices and other lovely nice healthy food .. this place is a must try place .. any one will find the type of food that will satisfy him for sure
"My experience in the actual restaurant was fine, and the gnocchi I ordered tasted good when I ate it. However, around 2 hours later when I got home I had severe vomiting and diarrhoea which lasted all through the evening and into the night. Be warned!"
"From J Boy of DerbyNicholson's pubs are usually excellent and this one is no exceptionFriendly staff good choice of beers, clean and buzzing with the usual West End crowd at weekends.Can't comment on the food as have not eaten here but would recommend if on a night out doing a pub crawl."
"Was told about this place and fought its got be worth a go. Well your host Tom is one hell of a character and a very lovely guy. Its simple you chat he tells you the menu you choose you drink and dinner appears. Its a notch above your average pub food. Great proteins real flavours and lots of it. Plus the atmosphere is superb and they do a mean pint of Guinness. Just go try its worth it and you will go back. Tom thank you making it fun. Plus the Steak and Guinness Pie, Lamb Shank and Cottage pie were superb.www.green-pea.org"
"I visited this branch on Saturday 11th March with my boyfriend. We shared the freakshow chicken for our starter (which I really recommend) and both had burgers and fries for a our main. The food was served promptly, as were the drinks. My fries were a tad dry, but the burger was pleasant enough. When the bill came we thought it seemed a lot. On closer inspection we realised it had a £5 gratuity charge. After asking the waitress (Abi) about the charge, I requested if we could take it off and she seemed annoyed and asked me why.I worked in hospitality for 4 years and though we didn't add on tips to the bill, I would not dream of questioning a customer as to why they didn't want to pay this charge - which is optional - and make them feel uncomfortable. Once we had paid on the card machine she took it and walked off without saying anything, though her NVC's said everything. I would say the service was good, but nothing great. ive had nicer burgers at the likes of Bills and The Handmade Burger Co, where the service has been better and the food bill has been less. While the staff were generally pleasant at this restaurant, I think the attitude of this particular waitress needs to be worked on. If I learnt anything from working in hospitality it's to smile and be professional, even if you disagree with the customer. Clearly more training is needed."
"I live around the corner so come in often. The food is delicious! And I'm extra impressed with the coffee which is really good, especially considering I get mine with almond milk, so hats off to the skilled baristas.I find the service excellent, staff are friendly and accommodating. The chef and owner created a breakfast that catered to my housemates dietary restrictions, even cleaning the grill before he made it, and on a busy Sunday! I can understand the service may be slow sometimes (although I have never found it a problem) as it's a small kitchen and the cafe gets busy but hey if you want instant, choose fast food, otherwise be patient, it's worth it :-)"
"The Richmond is local-ish to us and we go fairly regularly - mainly for the oyster happy hour as their oysters are absolutely top of the range and the discount allows us to fulfil our sea otter bivealve dreams with maximum greed! A trip on Friday with my husband's colleagues was a win - new additions to the sharing menu including the scallops with anchovy butter and duck egg with morels are top notch, service is friendly, welcoming and personal without being overwhelming and both the house white wine and cocktails (Sage Agains the Machine and Nefertiti particularly) are well above par. They were very helpful and understanding about shifting numbers in our party and our lead waitress was delightfully helpful and funny. In our own earlier experience the steaks have been less strong (though I hear better reports from my brother-in-law). But if fresh, fresh, fesh zesty seafood is your thing this place is a real gem."
"Nice service in the restaurant that looks like a cafe turned into a restaurant, but if you want just the taste of the fish and chips, use the take away from this restaurant."
To be honest i was unsure from ordering here because of the decor but thought ill give it a try.The food was below average from others ive had in south London. i had the butter chicken which had no taste and lamb madras which i think was just cooked in powder. Wont go back
"Visited this place by chance after see a free event advertised. The location is a little out of the way but it was worth it for the music, the service and the drinks. The menu was a little basic and the chicken was a little dry that night but no-one is perfect. The drinks were served at the perfect temperature and in the correct glasses and the food was well presented and hot.I would definitely visit again."
"I admit that I like very good food, in nice posh restaurants, but I love, as well, junk American food. A burger, chicken wings, ribs. Once in a while I indulge myself with one of these. I went with my husband after work, to have some beers (they have Sam Adams which is one of my favorites) and wings. But this restaurant is sooooo bad. Service is hideous, table very dirty, and the food is so bad. I would have microwave food before what we had.If you happen to be around covent garden, and fancy junk, cheap, good food, please do not stop here. There are so many other options. For instance, GBK with great great burgers, or Pizza Express, I love their thin pizza. Or any of the many other restaurants available in that zone. Friday's is not worth it. And if you are American, run Forrest, run!!! Because you will not have the same quality, and you will pay 60% more... prices are the same (value wise) if it is $10 in US it is £10 in UK..."
"Hotel restaurant was quiet on Mother's Day. It should have been our first clue. Olives left us wanting better when we visited a few months ago.  Food: We tried fish and lasagna as our mains. They were OK. Good ingredients certainly, and well prepared. But if the answer to ÏHow was your fish is Ïfine, you do not have a home run.Atmosphere: It's a very nice room. Has a classic fine dining look. Think business meeting, nicer dates. Not Mayfair high-end by any stretch of the imagination, but solid.Service: No problems. Responsive. Price: For London hotel food I'd say the price was reasonable. We did not feel like we got awesome value, but we did not feel ripped off either. There are far too many unique and delicious places to try in London not to have at least a memorable evening. You won't be wowed here."
"Great place for Sunday lunch. Proper old school leather padded booths and marble topped tables. Food was really well done and portions generous. People really firndly and looked liked they enjoyed what they did. Well done guys, i for one shall return!"
"My friends took me here for my birthday and I'm so happy as we had the best time! The cocktails and food was outstanding. And, the service was great - lots of chirpy characters! I'm wanting to take my husband here as I know he would love it!"
"Expecting a pleasant afternoon on the Hispaniola with a slap up meal to boot.Not quite, there was a large group of us who had paid in advance for what we thought was a three course meal. Thus it was not to be, firstly we were told where to sit, all of us where on a big round table. We started looking at the menu only to be told that wasn't for us we were to have a 2 choice fixed menu.Slightly disappointed but nevertheless we didn't complain. Then we were told no drinks were included we had to go to the bar and buy them.Eventually the meals Arrived although it was haute cuisine and very tasty the portions weren't huge.We seemed to be rushed through even though no-one else came aboard."
"Visiting Kensington Palace and State Apartments at Buckingham Palace so parked our car at Royal Garden Hotel and had lunch at Park Terrace Restaurant. Very reasonably priced, excellent service and good choice of food."
"We went in here before saying goodby to our visitors. We did not have starters due to the time restriction (Andy Murray Wimbledon) but none the less, we just went for the main courses. Chilli Fillet Beef was very good - Tender and flavoursome. Free Chicken Curry was exactly the same as we have had in Thailand a few months ago. And last of all 2 x Fragrant Fried Chicken. If it was not for the flavour of the Beef and the Chicken Curry my scoring would have been lower... My negatives: Portions was very small. Rice dominated the plates. Although a little sauce was provided with the Fried Chicken dish, it was not sufficient and was deemed dry. I'd love to go back but I'm afraid due to the fact that this is a chain, my comments will fall on deaf ears and the chain will continue putting out dishes as described above. Nonetheless, if you want to pop in here for a quick meal, you on face value should not be dissapointed."
"Visited the Green Pea for Sunday breakfast with family. Within minutes the owner had made us all feel as if we were close friends who had been coming for 20 years. Breakfast was excellent....big portions of great sausages, Irish white and black pudding, bacon, eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, excellent bread and enormous pots of tea. Quirky surroundings completed a terrific experience.....nothing was too much trouble. The owner was right, we are regulars now!"
Great atmosphere great food. A meal and much conversation without being chased as some restaurants do. Menu covers all the requirements of a good Italian.
Came here for a meal with family early Saturday evening. Had one of the best meals ive had in a while. Manager was really nice but waitress who followed seemed aloof. Had salmon tapenade and a brilliant marinated steak (slices) dish for main.The cocktails were good too. Only one beer on tap and a bit noisy (next to busy junction) but can't fault it otherwise. Still gets 5 because of the quality of food.
"I love all TGIs but this one is my favourite. The atmosphere is great, the staff are very attentive and the food is amazing. We visit here every time we go to London and always have a good time. Its basically what you expect from a TGIs."
"Food and service was excellent - quite surprised by just how good it was. The views are also lovely, great spot to eat. However, the overall decor is very tired and needs a loving injection of money to bring this boat up to standard and the ladies toilets left a lot to be desired. Real shame as I would recommend it otherwise, but more care with it needs to be taken, especially with the cleanliness of the loos."
This pub is hidden in the side streets of Liverpool Street station and Spitalfields and is worth finding. Great range of craft ales and ciders on tap. Lots of different areas and hideaways to sit with a nice atmosphere. Reasonable range of food but we were drinking and watching the Euro football so cannot comment.
Across from the LSE this is not friendly to the average students budget but for a group we were well treated. Comfortable atmosphere and food was good not great. Carrot soup was tasty but a bit thick. Fish was good but the sauce a bit on the rich side. Good portion though. The chocolate mousse wAs decent. Though I'm not a huge mousse person.
"Did takeaway service. Packaging was great, and quality of food stayed consistently well after 20-30 minutes. Katsudon was a little mushy, but not sure if was related to packaging. Will try it in restaurant next time."
"Had to check out a restaurant rated so highly and was not disappointed. First rate pies, great chips and real gravy served with piles of fresh veg. Tom is a charming host and I can't wait to go back."
"I honestly can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was yesterday, when we went to Tredwells ... I'm a vegetarian, and to be honest, I never really have high expectations... but, as being aubergine was on the menu, and it is my most vegetable, my hopes were lifted... unfortunately, I felt like I was eating cardboard.. my side, of broccoli.. was literally raw broccoli (which I quite like) coated in smooth peanut butter with capers and almonds (please note, that does not ((at all)) work) ... but by far, the worst thing was watching my poor friend (I'd chosen to visit Tredwells, and she didn't want to upset me!!) trying to cut through her lamb... I'm really not joking, at (very) least half of it was un cooked fat... and bone... she ploughed her way through (God alone knows how) I asked her loads to send it back but again, I know she didn't want to upset me, and I had the most cringing experience ever, where after we left, I had to wait outside Mc Donald's (ive not stepped foot inside one for at least 23 years) while she went in to order food because she was still hungry... ive eaten (much) better food in chain restaurants (that I hate to go in) I as I said, was completely disappointed... Marcus, hang your head in shame!"
"It's a busy Friday night and my boyfriend and I are starving! With the idea stuck in our heads of dining out, we set off from my work to find somewhere to eat. Bypassing the usual restaurants in Hays Galleria, with just a short walk down by the river we saw Strada. My Boyfriend suggested we went in ""if they had calzone"". I knew that in the past Strada restaurants have let me down, but with Tower Bridge and the river lit up and the view from the restaurant how could I refuse? I'm so glad we went. it was £57 for three courses x2 and 2 glasses of red!!! delicious romantic atmosphere - I barely noticed I was in Strada. staff were great!!! if you get a chance go :) tasty!!!"
"Popped in for early evening cocktails and some food. Made to feel very welcome, great service, bar staff were very helpful explains which cocktails had special offers available. Real mix of age groups! Good choice of beers, spirits and cocktails. Simple menu, they know what they are good at and served an excellent burger and fries! Good value for money and good atmosphere, will be popping back next time in London!"
"Random breakfast pop-in and how lovely it was. The staff were attentive, chatty and the food was served quickly and very tasty indeed."
"We found the Cork & Bottle by accident as we were getting out of the rain before buying theatre tickets. We decided to skip the afternoon show and enjoyed a charming afternoon tasting a range of wines with good pub food. We've made repeat visits on every trip to the UK and have watched it grow up a bit... larger menu, more refined dining options, perhaps a bit of a 'facelift.' However, that drew us in the first time remains true: it's a tribute to wines that people can afford to drink. Oh, yes, you can find a grande cru Burgundy and fine marque Champagne on the list, but that's not the point here. There over a hundred wines available by the glass, half bottle, or bottle at very fair prices. This is where wine lovers hang out, make new friends, and try new bottles. It's common to see former strangers pass glasses back and forth between tables when they find something wonderful. We send everyone we know, and and always go back. That should say enough. Oh, be sure to buy one for the staff while you're there; their wine knowledge is what makes it so great!"
Needed to grab some food before a concert and didn't have much timeSo popped in to john Lewis to see what they hadDidn't fancy the sandwiches on top floor so tried Rossopomodoro intead Best decisionI had veal slice as a starter - highly recommendedWe shared a pizza cornucopia again excellentProbably best pizza I have ever hadPolenta chips were less successful - but interestingMeal for 2 with glass of wine and soft drinks was £50Service was excellent and prompt Definitely worth a revisit
"It was lovely ambience, service was brilliant and super fast as well as the food being delicious ! Thank you :)"
"This was the second time we ended out Saturday morning trip with lunch at the local GBK. The food and service are very good. There is, as always, an interesting selection of burgers to choose from and it's hard to go wrong with your choice. If you pop in a bit early before the 1pm lunch rush, it will be easier to grab a table."
"I have dined here a handful of times over the past few years, I find myself asking Why am I here again? So much better on offer within a 3 or 4 minute walk.(Wilton road). Basic tapas. Service with attitude. Why bother. I won't again."
"Managed to get a table in this lovely gem to celebrate my birthday, was slightly concerned due to the last reviews, we decided anyway to book the table to see if they were right or not.Easy parking spot just in front the restaurant free of charge after 18:00 and that is already an extra point for who's driveing in London. We've been welcomed by one of the managers by the accent I think was Italian, nicely attired; he suggested to have a glass of champagne in the small but cozy bar area whilst the table was getting ready four us. We were slightly early.After few minutes he took us to the dining areas, the table was facing the windows and thanks to the bright evening the experience was even more exciting at the natural moon light.We decided to try the tasting menu to get treated with the full dining experience, dish after dish was an increase of flavours that all matched with the wine pairing the extra mile was already reached after the 2nd course. Service was attentive to the minimum details, they all knew what they were doing and you can be able to read on their face the happiness on delivering a great experience to their guests. Not so common nowadays in most of the Restaurants in London.The egg with the brioche bun, the white asparagus and strawberry, the octopus with chorizo, the monkfish, the pork... our tastebuds were in heaven. We decided than to get also a selection of cheeses, a waiter well trained came with a trolley and explained us more than 20 different kind of cheeses.At the end the dessert a combination of coconut, cherry and dill, a proper flavour explosion in your palate. We left the place extremely happy and with no space not even for a bread crum in our stomach. We will come back definitely soon to get delivered a fantastic food and wine experience.Well done guys."
This pub is conveniently located in St Pancras station near the Eurostar. It is the top of the stairs at the end of the station just by the very large bronze statue of the parting couple. The pub has several areas where you can eat or drink including a bistro type area & a more upmarket restaurant area. We meet four friends for lunch who had come into London for the day so it was very convenient for all 3 couples who were travelling The service was prompt and attentive with a reasonable menu. It has a small outside area as well as a covered bistro style eating area in the station just adjacent to the entrance on the station side For a quick meal or drink or for a more lingering meal with travelling friends it is well worth considering We
"We have been here a few times and the location is great, service quiet good and food often great, although a bit pricey. Natasha who works there is fantsastic, really helpful and always cheerful. Most of the waiting staff too, are happy to help. I realise we pay for the view and location, but it is a bit steep. The gangway on and off is also often a bit steep, but it's a boat on the river so that's exactly what you expect. We will definitely be back again."
"A friend and I went in yesterday for dinner, we were seated and our order was taken promptly. Our burgers were juicy and Arrived pretty swiftly considering how busy it was. My mate added chilli and cheese to his chips and combined with the hot sauce were amazing. I should also add though that the table in front of us complained about something and when the manager went over she managed to diffuse the situation, but not without a fair amount of arguing back and forth. It seemed the customer was being quite difficult but nonetheless it was a small blemish on an otherwise very nice meal"
"We went to Hardcore Lobster and more last Saturday and it lived up to my expectations. We had the calamari, prawns and lobster and crab pate as starters. The Calamari was exceptional, prawns were good but perhaps slightly overdone and the pate was very flavoursome. I had the steak and had lobster combo, steak not the most tender but great flavour. The lobster was excellent. My wife had the sea bream which she thoroughly enjoyed. 4 out of 5 as I felt the staff could use some improvement ( some were fantastic, others were clearly in need of some more experience) and the fact that the steak could of been a bit more tender. However, Well priced for what we had. Would go again."
"I'm usually a regular customer of this chain, but hadn't been for ages (saving money), but my friend convinced me to go and try their Christmas ham hock toastie, I'm so glad he did as it was absolutely delicious if it wasn't so calorific I could easily binge on these. So so yummy. Looking forward to next year!"
"Great place to come to with family - good for veggies and healthy eaters but has some comfort food on there too. Think a lot of the food is homemade, but in any case it's quite wholesome food.Would strongly recommend!"
visited the tube museum round the corner and had a late lunch here with 5 friends. ordered 6 pizzas and they were all really nice. Quick service and very reasonable pricing. definatly worth a visit
"So I don't mind waiting for a table during a busy time, but I'd appreciate a reasonable guess at how long we might expect to wait. That's one of the major roles of the reception staff. We were asked if we wanted inside or outside, as apparently the wait was different. Fair enough - we plumped for the shorter wait (inside). I was told we can't wait for the first available table, we had to choose one or the other. That should have been enough of a warning to me. Unfortunately I was seduced by reviews of the (admittedly very good) coffee. So we waited at the bar,and waited,and waited,and waited.Other diners came in and were seated ahead of us, inside and outside. We asked a number of times - politely at first, then increasingly less politely, when we might expect a table. On entering we were told the wait would be 20 minutes. An hour later we were seated, essentially because we walked over and sat down at a just-vacated table. The kids were starving, and if I was curt with the staff perhaps you can understand why. I was only responding to the way I was being treated. Some tips for the future1. Get front of house staff who have a better idea of timing.2. Don't keep lying to prospective diners about when a table will be ready. Sure it tends to keep them in the place, but they get annoyed and write reviews like this.3. Two separate lists for inside or outside? Dumb.The food was ok. The coffee was better than good. The service was woeful."
Had a really good night in here back in June. Really liked it. It is a downstairs bar. I liked the fact that we got a table and they hadn't over crammed the place. They were turning people away when there were no tables available. Leaving us to just enjoy the evening.The cocktails were really good. We had a lot of them! Not too expensive either. Well worth a night out.
great choice of Asian food
Been a customer since my uni days over 20 years ago. Still good standard food. Service is as expected if any Chinese restaurant. Friendly and unpretentious
"Not the first time I have visited and each time has been just as good. The food is very traditional English I had the Cornish cod in a lentil and mushroom sauce with some of the best chips I have ever had. My friend had the roast leg of lamb with seasonal veg, having been before we both skipped the starters so that we would have room for pudding, and they really are puddings not desserts, the custard at Rules is to die for so my choice of pudding is limited to the ones that come with custard although on other visits I have asked for and been served custard with other puddings The service at Rules has to be the best in London if not the UK I think they only employ waiters qualified in mind reading as they always seem to anticipate what I want before I have asked.It is a bit pricey but worth every pennyMy only reservation is that it is not the place to go if your table manners are not top notch which as far as I am concerned is a good thing"
"1st time i ever tried this place, probably the last... chips tasted bland, like reheats... had a battered sausage with it, which wern't too bad, bit watery! all for 4 quid... which is well over a quid more than i pay anywhere else!... that's Hampstead for you i guess. can't comment on ""dine in"" experience, as i'm a lodin delivery driver, and only do take-aways. friendly staff though... can't fault that. just need to up their game on the chips, and maybe do a better price!"
"Thanks to Ana, our server for taking care of us so well and being friendly. Had the empire spiced chicken with spicy lemon greek yoghurt sauce. Chicken was good and juicy, spicy yoghurt was actually pleasantly spicy. Potatoes it came with were very well seasoned. Prices were good for the middle of covent garden. My fatger had a pizza which are the cheaper options and the crust was nice on it. Good eats."
"ive been drinking and eating in the coronet for the last 10yrs plus and its the first time ive had to moan,went to order 1155 wouldnt let me order sunday meal to early and then when i order 10 mins later meal arrives cold 2 thin slices of meat 4 roast potatos and the carrots were so hard i might of well had beer mat as the side,new managment recently in the coronet has brought dissintrested staff and low moral ,i think its time for a change"
"I have tried a lot of fish & chips in London, and these are by far the best I have found (admittedly, some were not good). Your order is taken and prepared fresh, which means a little bit of wait, but it's worth it. One taste will have you leave saying ""smashing,"" even if you are not British!"
"We met on the rooftop for a leisurely Sunday breakfast and had excellent coffee and good (if pricey) pastries. The terrace has a great, relaxed atmosphere and we liked it so much we decided to stay on and have lunch in the basement Boundary restaurant. There was an excellent £20 two course offer on for Sunday lunch and our group had cod, beef, guineafoul and goats cheese tart, all of which were excellent. Puddings of ice cream, creme brÌÈlee, meringue and cheese were also all first class. Wine, herbal tea and more coffee added to another excellent meal. The decor was good, the bathrooms top notch but the best thing of all was the service. When we sat down freh bread was brought to our table and, best of all, it was kept topped up. The same was the case with the complimentary water. All in all the waiting team could not have been more helpful or more discrete. Excellent from start to, much later than anticipated, finish."
"I have recently had two gatherings at the Mitre. One on a Saturday evening with friends celebrating my engagement and a Sunday lunch with my family two weeks later. Both events were fantastic. The staff were extra helpful and informative leading up to both! And on the days they were friendly, quick and delightful.The food on both occasions (a small buffets for the party and 33 three courses meals on the Sunday) were delicious! And good value for money! On the Saturday they had a live band and on the Sunday the showed all of the sports and had a quiz.A lovely friendly welcoming local! I will definitely be going here again for all of our gatherings. Thank you."
Drinks are quite nice! But the place is average and the music is not good! A lot of drum n bass is being played which doesn't go well with the atmosphere of a pub!
"We had dinner there on our way back from a walk: the atmosphere catched our attention, and we gave it a try. The staff was very kind, our waiter, Jenny, was very polite and friendly. She gave us very good suggestions: my wife and I had the fillet, whilst our daughter had the steak ... All served with perfectly cooked fries! And accompanied by a very good red wine, a Bordeaux ... We will definitively return there soon! Recommended."
"Dropped in after a few hours in the British Museum. A great place to rest your feet, have a bite and a relaxed drink for a weekday lunch. A good find!"
"On a very cold winter day we dreamt of winter in Snow in London. There was no snow in London yet, but a Swiss Restaurant. So we tried to book a table and were told that they war fully booked unit X-Mas, but if we were lucky there were availability after 9pm. We went there at 9pm, waited 5 minutes and got a table. We got our ""winter and Swiss experience"" for two hours and were not disappointed: one of the best Cheese Fondues we ever had, authentic starter with dried Beef (Buendner Fleish?), and phantastic Swiss whyte and red wines. The atmosphere is like a old and cosy Swiss Chalet, with alphorn and a lot of wood, all midst in Soho. On top of it we met the very nice owner, a 78yo Swiss guy who introduced us to Swiss wines: we were impressed in any respect.His secret to look so young with 78 years: you need to work harde.. Well, a truly Swiss experience..."
"The place has a nice after work vibe and the bar area is nice to hang out and have after work drinks. The music is relatively loud, which is nice if you are just having drinks but not ideal for dinner. The quality of the food is only average but the price is set accordingly. There are some quirky aspects to the place making it somewhat interesting but all in all there sin't much of a ""Fable"" theme going on. Not bad, but not great."
"After a disappointing experience at Zizzi we tried Nandos, what a difference! The manager was excellent, seated and greeted within minutes, offered to take our bags (we were on our way to airport) and look after them - such a chilled and friendly guy, despite a very busy lunch service. The food was wonderful - loved the idea of the basin for hand washing before you eat without having to trek to a loo! Will visit again without a doubt!"
i have been here a few times and evertyime this place does not disappoint with their sunday Roast.great for meeting friends or taking family for restaurant. the Vibe is always very chilled. MUST GO ON A SUNDAY FOR THE ROAST.
"We had a fantastic dining experience at the Skylon, it was at the beginning of my Vegan change and they made me feel extremely welcomed. The food was excellent, also my non-vegan husband loved it. Highly recommended for a great relaxing dinner, the atmosphere is chilled and the view over the Thames is very suggestive."
"As shared by another reviewer we used to go to another more expensive sushi restaurant up the road. The food here is stunning and far cheaper without any compromise on quality. The service and entire team at the restaurant are great, all super friendly, helpful and fun! My new favourite local!"
"As we had not booked breakfasts at our hotel this was the second of our three breakfasts, after the Buttery at Burgh House and before St Martins in the Field crypt.I had my usual full English, with yoghurt, apple juice and espresso, she had fruit salad, croissant, yoghurt, cranberry juice and 2 coffees. This was just the second most expensive, and although the food was good, we felt the service was not so good as usually the case at Cote."
"Service was faultless throughout - friendly, relaxed but incredibly efficient.The Cocktail that you can have instead of the Champagne for the upgrade to £50 (from £40) was delicious and came ""steaming"" with good theatrics. Worth it for that alone.As for the food, thankfully it was not an all sandwich affair for the savoury, however those same sandwiches were a little bit dry, and the turkey ones (on rye break with cranberry) had a single slice of turkey ham in them rather than actual turkey.Sweets were innovative and they offered us a box to take away leftovers rather than us asking which was a nice touch.Tip - try and sit on the mezzanine - the lobby setting in which some people appeared to be eating is eating in an actual hotel lobby."
"3 of us went here recently for Sunday lunch and it was perfect. The food was delicious and fresh. They didn't have one of the dishes available that we ordered, but the alternative was lovely. The dessert was also very good. It's not on the main high street but still definitely worth the visit. The service was friendly and helpful too. Will look forward to going back :)"
Great atmosphere and happy hour made it amazing value!!!Lovely huge cocktail jug and bottle of wine for £20! Kicked off our Friday night perfectly!
"Last night I went to the Charterhouse Bar with my husband, using a voucher from Liveingsocial.com which included a cocktail, a shared Asian food platter and live jazz music. NEVER again. We got there and after ordering the cocktails at the bar, were told to head upstairs and to sit down wherever we could. It was akin to a free for all scrum. By the time everybody had sat down, there was only one free table left right at the back in the awfully narrow room where the event was taking place. Anyway, we sat down and eventually the food Arrived. What a disgrace! It was a joke, how can they serve it? They should feel ashamed of themselves. The platter came with a bowl of what was supposed to be pork with rice. It was utterly tasteless, and completely devoid of any pork! We were also given a bowl of soy beansprouts, two skewers of prawns and pineapple, and 4 mini spring rolls, which tasted as if they had come straight from the freezers of an Iceland supermarket. We were effectively served execrable cheap food, and it is unacceptable. We paid £19 for the voucher, but the supposed ÷full' price for this is £40. Honestly, who would pay that? It has to go down as one of the worst food experiences I have had during my decade in London. The place should be shut down. And the jazz, well, in was awful. Nothing personal against the poor girl singing. We were so upset by the whole experience that we left after 15 minutes. We will never, ever step foot in that bar or purchase anything from Liveingsocial.com again."
"Booked the Gentlemans Afternoon Tea, to a surprise of Steak and Snail sandwiches!! The size of the dishes can seem a little small to the price you are paying, but if you relax and take your time, you are soon full between all the cakes. Scones were delicious and still warm, the selection was good! You get a two hour time slot and they don't bring the bill to you a minute sooner, so free-flowing champagne can definitely be worth it - friendly staff on hand to help and refill without asking. As a special occasion, I think it was overall very good!"
"Had the lamb burger and the blue cheese burger. Both were good and tasty. The meat was tasty. Asked for medium rare but the beef was a bit overcooked. The waitress was really nice and brought a new one which was medium rare. Service was quick and nice. Had the poutine and normal fries, both were average. Price for burger was fair. Poutine fries were overpriced. Overall it was good. Would come again to try the other burgers."
"We ate last night accompanied by friends. The restaurant has a offer at the moment - £60 per couple excluding drinks, but includes a cocktail and cheese board. The menu is seasonal and absolutely sensational. The scallop starter was diveine, the lamb main course absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked! The banana tart tatin to die for. The service exceptional, our waitress was called Nora and she was an absolute star!"
"I just moved to London and a vegan friend of mine took me here. I am not vegan, but I love sushi and I was impressed by the range of tastes and textures. If you like healthy but tasty food, you have to try this restaurant. Finally, compared to London average prices, it's not expensive!"
We popped in on the way past and enjoyed a nice drink in the sunshine on the top deck. I would have liked an option of vodka instead of just giveing me Smirnoff and my pint could have been full. But we enjoyed the quick drink while my SO could withstand the boat rocking.
"We came here mid December for midweek lunch and it was really good. The service was superb (Javier) and food was very good. The venue is simply stunning. I would go again but it is expensive so its probably got 2 visits in it max before you need to go see other restaurants along the same vain, of which there are now A LOT!"
The Shoyu Ramen completely stole the show. Amazing considering that it is a little cramped place we stumbled upon because the kids were staving. Will be back!!
"Pre Theatre Dinner was booked and every promise was made that they would get us fed, watered and out in time for the ENO (almost next door) at 7.30.We Arrived slightly earlier than our reservation and a table was ready. We ordered from the pre-theatre menu and reminded them of the time constraint. Again promises that we would be served swiftly and that there was plenty of time.Well ... the food didn't appear and every time we chased it we were told that they would 'check with the kitchen'. When it finally Arrived there was no time to enjoy it. We paid the bill before the desert Arrived to avoid delay. They were quick enough getting the bill paid but the desert again didn't arrive until too late. When it did arrive it was not what had been ordered but there was not enough time to wait for the correct desert, so we left in a hurry.So disappointing. The meal was bolted and not enjoyed. The desert was paid for but never received. The promised swift service didn't materialise. No apology was received. It felt like there were plenty of customers so no need to worry about what sort of service they were giveing. When there is plenty of demand the quality of the experience is not important.My final thought (but too late) was that in paying the bill in a hurry I left a 12.5% tip which is automatically included in the bill. The last thing I wanted to do was leave a tip for that terrible service.How I regret going there. No service, No enjoyment, No apology, No desert and I left a tip to make me feel even more as though I had been taken for a ride."
Very tasty and affordable . Fast food at its best with a taste of proper Italian pizza . One of my best places to have a pizza in East London
"Excellent roast dinner, fast service, great price and lovely place in general.Was a lucky find as couldn't get a table elsewhere but will be going back again and again."
"SO delicious. I have lived in Notting Hill all my life and it is probably my favourite food here. Be sure to get the aubergines, chickpeas, thai green curry, spinach, and dahl! I have always got the food to take-away because the setting is slightly canteen-like. Very inexpensive."
"Staff at Putney Wagamama are great! They are friendly, efficient and on the ball. The food is lovely too but I'd suggest it's better as a light alternative and not to go if you're too hungry, especially as a starter, main and drink comes to around £25. That being said, I definitely recommend a visit!"
We went on a Monday evening and the restaurant had a lovely atmosphere. The food was excellent and we enjoyed the cocktails. The food was very tasty and the service was friendly. Would recommend and go again.
This is such a lovely restaurant. We came across it totally by chance but couldn't have asked for a happier atmosphere or more delicious food (and wine!). Excellent service and Patrick himself made us feel very welcome. Would definitely recommend and hope to make a return visit soon ourselves.
The Croissants are perfect here. Also the salmon sandwiches and the crayfish are great. I also tried for the first time the dried mango slices for 99p - tasty and healthy - loved them. I have no prob popping into a Pret whenever in the UK for a quick bite - their sushi isn't bad either.
To say this was delicious is a vast understatement. Every dish - and we had many - was incredibly flavorful.
"Superb food , service and value and well worth a visit. Tom is very accommodating and always goes out of his way to make me feel welcome"
"Good variety on the menu. Quite pricey for the portion sizes, although the pizzas looked the best value. 2 starters with 1 bottle of beer and a soft drink = £16."
"This is the second visit I have made , the first in a large party with a set meal was good and so I returned again for a dinner with a friend .We were not disappointed , the food is excellent - interesting and imaginative courses including the vegetarian options and the desserts and cheese board very good. The best part though on both occasions was the staff in the reception , bar and the restaurant - helpful , knowledgeable, cheerful and all seeming to be enjoying their roles . That is a rarity these days ."
"Four of us went out to Polpo in Smithfield to celebrate my wife's birthday. The menu was unusual at first sight, broken down into small parts, being a kind of Venetian equivealent to an upmarket tapas eatery. We had some plates to share and others just for ourselves. Everything was of the highest quality, from vegetarian to very meaty options. The octopus was fabulous (as you might expect). Our waiter was extremely good, helpful and attentive but not getting in the way. The decor in the restaurant was great, with rugged bare brick and iron-window framed mirrors. We ate early, 7pm, so even though it was Saturday evening, and we hadn't booked, we had no problem getting in. Will most definitely go again."
Great location next to Tower Bridge. The waiters were really kind to my daughter and we all had a relaxing meal.
"A great British tradition. Afternoon tea at the Ritz. The building and tea room has beautiful architecture and decor while the waiters were smart, polite and efficient. The finger sandwiches were okay as were the scones and cakes but despite wonderful descriptions didn't quite hit the high standard expected. It is more of a triumph of style over substance but nice to have visited such an iconic location."
"Six of us managed to nab a table in the upstairs 'cider bar' part of Belushi's for some lunch. A nice, bright room with some comfy seats. The down side of being upstairs is that we were limited to drinking what they have available at the small bar in that room, and we weren't allowed to order anything out-with that from table service. We could have gone downstairs and got a better selection from that bar and bring it up, but it seemed like a bit of a pain so we got what we could from the upstairs bar. We all ordered different variants of burgers and although they took what seemed like ages for them to arrive, they tasted quite good when they eventually got to us. A little too chargrilled in places but tasty enough.Food service was slow, but friendly. A nice spot to chill for an hour or two and get a burger to try and chase away a hangover."
"Rules Restaurant in London is listed as one of the oldest restaurants in London, and it is easy see why it has been a success for so many decades. The food selections include many wild game dishes and other unusual items, all tastefully prepared and served with elegant presentation. The atmosphere is absolutely stunning with a plethora of mounted game and historical pictures covering the walls, all of which is framed in dark mahogany woodwork and beautiful chandeliers. From the Top Hat adorned Gentleman greeting you outside and the tuxedoed waiters, to the linen table cloths and stemware on the tables, this establishment is stunning and original. We were casually dressed in polo shirts and kakis, but most other guests were in suits and ties. We totally enjoyed our dining experience and recommend it as a Ïdon't miss this eatery."
"I booked this restaurant based on the online reviews and I was not disappointed. The restaurant looks a bit shabby from the outside, and the tables are not set with crisp white linen or crystal glass, but the food is unbelievable.I had the foie gras on ginger bread to start. Sounds odd but tasted wonderful. I then had a second starter for my main course-scallop and crab ravioli. I wanted to bathe in the sauce, truly heavenly. I chose the dessert of Creme BrÌÈlee which was gorgeous.The wine was chilled and expertly served by the wonderful owner/host. He had me and my party in stitches. Brilliant sense of humour and it made our night.Thank you so much - I can't wait to visit again ‰_•ü‰_•ü‰_•ü"
"Popped in for a Sunday morning breakfast.The atmosphere was fantastic and the staff were very friendly, but sadly although the food looked great it didn't really taste of anything. The poached eggs in particular were just texture, ive never eaten such a flavourless egg in all my life! The coffee and the hot chocolate were really good though"
"Met friends for an early evening meal before catching a train. The service was slow, taking ten minutes before someone came to us. I wasn't particularly happy with my meal, though my friends were more content with theirs. We were surrounded by families and children. Perhaps this would be a more interesting occasion later in an evening, with the chance to savour the cocktails."
"Once again we were met by Zoltan, - assistant manager elect for sure - and he remembered us from last October - only a true professional can achieve this amazing memory trick !  The ambience is exceptional in this elegant dining room, There was even the hint of a great meal to come as you approach the restaurant Reception. Warm, and invitingWe had the four course special voucher meal, but unlike other inferior restaurants that give you a special reduced menu and serve you vastly reduced fare for your money, this restaurant allows you the full a la carte menu at this amazing price.Four friends dined on sea trout, 2 X rizzotto and a salmon souffle each to start - Diveine - followed by 2 X Lamb and 2 X Steak main courses - perfectly cooked.This was followed by an amuse bouche of raspberry sorbet - gratis as was the wonderful bread before we started. Followed by four different desserts that we passed around to try a mouthful from each plate, AND this was followed by some petit fours and then an English Cheese plate. - We were so full by this time that we ended up taking the cheeses home in a doggy bag.Two of us had coffee that was extra. The only hint I would give management is that we would have happily swapped our cheese course for coffee as inclusive to our voucher price. How about it for the future? Perhaps it would be nice to give clients the choice.The meal included a cocktail to start. One lady had a Mojito that she pronounced the best ever. The remaining three had a glass of Pay D'Oc Sauvignon Blanc to start and we all thrilled to a particularly nice bottle of Chilean Viognier @ £35.00.Remember, this meal was only £49.00 for two. What a bargain.Long may they continue to thrill their clientele this way. We, as a group, will continue to attend, with vouchers or not.The waiting staff are wonderful and, as already mentioned, the kindness and great service from Zoltan did not go unnoticed. A treasure.Thank you, chefs and front of house staff. another great night, and we happily waddled away full to overflowing once again."
"Quite reasonable decor although touching on the bland. Service was attentive, although it was a busy night when we Arrived. Drinks Arrived promptly and so did the pappadums - were they waiting in reserve? Our mains Arrived in reasonable time and were fine - basic dishes which is what we ordered. So everything satisfactory with a healthy bill at the end."
"amazing food and service, cocktails really worked on, the waiters and staff really attentive plus the kitchen times really nice\.try the pani puris and the chilly paneer.the bombay xpress cocktail really amazing"
"I walk past here frequently but decided to try one Friday as they had 25% off.There are interesting side dishes of spiced lentils, quinoa and other flavours/ combinations to accompany the grilled skewers and most of the dishes appealed to me.Food was all of a high quality and had good taste but I haven't been back, largely because of the competition in the area and the price. I would always need to order a side dish to go with the skewer which bumps up the cost of lunch quite substantially. Even adding pitta bread and a small dip would make a difference to whether I returned or not, and I know other colleagues feel the same way."
"Having been put off burgers by Macdonalds and other trashy outlets, as well as stalls at markets, football grounds and even GBK, decided to risk Cote because of recommendation by friends. Extremely surprised at the very good quality of the meat, which seemed to have been cooked on a proper grill, and not one which had been supplemented by a fuel accelerant. Accompanying bun, fries and skin-on chips were also of good quality. Went the whole heart attack hog with caramel and honeycomb sundaes to finish. Service was extremely friendly, helpful, and efficient. Would certainly revisit."
Wow! This easy to miss establishment has some very knowledgeable bartenders creating some of the best cocktails ive had. Don't miss out!
"We took a party of 10 for a post-matinee dinner. The staff were very attentive from the outset and made us all very welcome.The food was good and Arrived without huge delays.Very nice grilled squid, pigeon breast and veggie chick pea cakes for starters. For mains the venison was nice pink and tender. The steaks were slightly more done than requested, but very tasty.Then you have the views down the Thames and the smart, but not too smart ambience.We all had a very memorable and enjoyable evening. Thanks to all the staff on the Hispaniola."
"We were looking forward to going to the Roundhouse after the good reviews. I booked a table on line and requested a seat outside on a warm Sunday evening. On arriveal all the outside tables were occupied and we were told you couldn't book outside tables in advance.We shared a portion of calamari and it was OK, not memorable. For mains, one of our group went for the fish and chips and said it was good, it was certainly a generous portion. Another went for a small salad with a portion of fries and two of us went for the Sunday Roast of beef. It was OK, the beef was advertised as medium rare but was overcooked and the accompanying vegetables were pleasant enough. It just lacked imagination and that little something that many restaurants manage to achieve with their Sunday roasts.Probably the last time we will visit as there are better pubs in Earlsfield that have atmosphere and also serve very good food."
