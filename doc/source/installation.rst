Installation
############

Requirements
============

The NLP Architect requires **Python 3.5+** running on a
Linux* or UNIX-based OS (like Mac OS). We recommend using the library with Ubuntu 16.04+.

Before installing the library make sure you has the most recent packages listed below:

.. csv-table::
   :header: "Ubuntu* 16.04+ or CentOS* 7.4+", "Mac OS X*", "Description"
   :widths: 20, 20, 42
   :escape: ~

   python-pip, pip, Tool to install Python dependencies
   libhdf5-dev, h5py, Enables loading of hdf5 formats
   pkg-config, pkg-config, Retrieves information about installed libraries

.. note::
  The default installation of NLP Architect use CPU-based binaries of all deep learning frameworks. Intel Optimized MKL-DNN binaries will be installed if a Linux is detected. GPU backed is supported online on Linux and if a GPU is present. See details below for instructions on how to install each backend.


Installation
============

We recommend installing NLP Architect within a virtual environment to ensure a self-contained environment.

To get started using our library, clone our repository:

.. code:: python

  git clone https://github.com/NervanaSystems/nlp-architect.git
  cd nlp-architect

Installing NLP Architect within a virtual environment to ensure a self-contained
environment is recommended.

Make sure ``pip`` and ``setuptools`` are updated:

.. code:: python

  pip3 install -U pip setuptools


.. include:: _quick_install.rst

Compiling IntelÂ® optimized Tensorflow with MKL-DNN
==================================================

NLP Architect supports MKL-DNN flavor of Tensorflow out of the box, however, if the user wishes to compile Tensorflow we provide instructions below.

Tensorflow has a guide `guide <https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources>`_ for compiling and installing Tensorflow with with MKL-DNN optimization. Make sure to install all required tools: bazel and python development dependencies.

Alternatively, follow the instructions below to compile and install the latest version of Tensorflow with MKL-DNN:

* Clone Tensorflow repository from github:

  .. code::

      git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
      cd tensorflow

* Configure Tensorflow for compilation:

  .. code::

      ./configure

* Compile Tensorflow with MKL-DNN:

  .. code::

      bazel build --config=mkl --config=opt //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package

* Create pip package in ``/tmp/tensorflow_pkg``:

  .. code::

      bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg

* Install Tensorflow pip package:

  .. code::

      pip install <tensorflow package name>.whl

* Refer to `this <https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_guide#tensorflow_with_intel_mkl_dnn>`_ guide for specific configuration to get optimal performance when running your model.
