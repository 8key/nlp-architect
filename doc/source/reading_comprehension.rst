Reading Comprehension
######################

Overview
========
This directory contains an implementation of the boundary model(b in the Figure) Match LSTM and
Answer Pointer network for Machine Reading Comprehension. The idea behind this
method is to build a question aware representation of the passage and use this representation as an
input to the pointer network which identifies the start and end indices of the answer.

**Model Architecture**

Files
======
- **nlp_architect/contrib/ngraph/match_lstm.py** -Contains different layers in ngraph required for the model
- **nlp_architect/utils/weight_initializers.py** - Contains functions to initialize the LSTM Cell in ngraph
- **examples/train.py** -Implements the end to end model along with the training commands
- **examples/utils.py**- Implements different utility functions to set up the data loader and to do the evaluation.
- **examples/prepare_data.py**- Implements the pipeline to preprocess the dataset


Datasets
========
This repository uses the SQuAD dataset. The preprossessing steps required prior to training are listed below:

1. mkdir data

2. Download the training and dev datasets  from here
https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/ and place the extracted json files in the `data` directory.
The terms and conditions of the data set license apply. Intel does not grant any rights to the data files.

3. Download the GloVe pretrained embeddings from  http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip and copy "glove.6B.300d.txt" into the  `data` directory.
For more information about GloVe please visit https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. The terms and conditions of the data set license apply. Intel does not grant any rights to the data files.

4. Preprocess the data set using this command

.. code:: python
python prepare_data.py --data_path data/

Training
========
Train the model using the following command

.. code:: python
python train.py --data_path data/ -bgpu --gpu_id 0

The command line options available are:

* ``--gpu_id`` select the gpu id train the model. Default is 0.
* ``--max_para_req`` enter the max length of the para to truncate the dataset.Default is 100. Currently the code has been tested for a maximum length of paragraph length of 100.
* ``--batch_size_squad`` enter the batch size (please note that 30 is the max batch size that will fit on a gpu with 12 gb memory). Default is 16.
* ``--data_path`` enter the path to the preprocessed dataset

Results
========
After training starts, you will see outputs like this:

.. code:: python

  Loading Embeddings
  creating training Set
  Train Set Size is 19260
  Dev set size is 2000
  compiling the graph
  generating transformer
  iteration = 1, train loss = 13.156427383422852
  F1_Score and EM_score are 0.0 0.0
  iteration = 21, train loss = 12.441322326660156
  F1_Score and EM_score are 8.333333333333332 0.0
  iteration = 41, train loss = 10.773386001586914
  F1_Score and EM_score are 6.25 6.25
  iteration = 61, train loss = 11.69123649597168
  F1_Score and EM_score are 6.25 6.25

Please note that after each epoch you will see the validation F1 and EM scores being printed out.
These numbers are a result of a much stricter evaluation and lower than the official evaluation numbers.

Considering the default setting, which has training set of 19260 examples and a development set of 2000 examples
after 15 epochs, you should expect to see a F1 and EM scores on the development set similar to this:

.. code:: python

  F1 Score ~35%
  EM Score ~25%
