I	O
have	O
had	O
classes	B-ASP
with	O
students	O
who	O
are	O
reading	O
at	O
elementary	O
school	O
level	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
so	O
freaking	O
embarrassed	O
.	O

Everything	O
is	O
as	O
promised	O
,	O
customer	B-ASP
service	I-ASP
is	O
great	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
organization	B-ASP
is	O
extremely	O
professional	O
.	O

I	O
honestly	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
UOP	B-ASP
is	O
in	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
money	O
rather	O
than	O
the	O
success	O
of	O
their	O
students	O
.	O

I	O
believe	O
this	O
university	B-ASP
is	O
of	O
good	O
quality	O
and	O
would	O
refer	O
others	O
to	O
it	O

First	O

foremost	O
,	O
since	O
eGroups.com	B-ASP
took	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
a	O

Our	O
problems	B-ASP
arose	O
later	O
on	O
in	O
the	O
process	O
,	O
and	O
were	O
numerous	O
.	O

I've	O
had	O
my	O
E*Trade	B-ASP
account	O
for	O
over	O
4	O
years	O
and	O
the	O
reason	O
is	O
because	O
of	O
inertia	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
nothing	O
but	O
good	O
experience	B-ASP
with	O
them	O
.	O

CAN'T	O
EASILY	O
GET	O
ON	O
PHONE	B-ASP

You	O
must	O
navigate	O
through	O
an	O
interminable	O

It	O
is	O
possible	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
knowledge	O
from	O
the	O
program	B-ASP
,	O
but	O
this	O
requires	O
the	O
student	O
to	O
read	O
all	O
the	O
materials	O
.	O

No	O
more	O
waiting	O
on	O
the	O
phone	O
for	O
2	O
hours	O
,	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
still	O
a	O
challenge	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
human	O
being	O
on	O
the	O
phone	O
and	O
even	O
more	O
difficult	O
to	O
get	O
someone	O
with	O
a	O
Series	O

Some	O
of	O
the	O
lists	B-ASP
can	O
generate	O
a	O

The	O
ability	B-ASP
to	O
communicate	O
and	O
write	O
is	O
ESSENTIAL	O
for	O
the	O
Online	O
Campus	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
friend	B-ASP
graduate	O
from	O
Devry	B-ASP
with	O
a	O
business	O
bachelors	O
in	O
project	O

she	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
doing	O
fine	O
and	O
is	O
heading	O
to	O
law	O
school	O

I	O
found	O
groups	B-ASP
that	O
were	O
perfect	O
for	O
me	O
and	O
have	O
made	O
some	O
friends	O
in	O
the	O
process	O
.	O

All	O
I	O
can	O
say	O
is	O
that	O
this	O
school	B-ASP
is	O
a	O
total	O
waste	O
of	O
time	O
.	O

There	O
were	O
professors	O
I	O
had	O
who	O
talked	O
bad	O
about	O
DeVry	B-ASP
during	O
class	O
,	O
that's	O
when	O
I	O
knew	O
how	O
big	O
of	O
a	O
mistake	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
DeVry	B-ASP

if	O

It	O

a	O
very	O
good	O
school	B-ASP

Ah	O
yes	O
,	O
my	O
first	O
experience	O
with	O
ETrade	B-ASP
customer	O
service	O
;	O
was	O
I	O
on	O
hold	O
for	O
45	O
minutes	O
or	O
a	O
full	O
hour	O
?	O

And	O
the	O
best	O
thing	O
about	O
Ecircles	B-ASP
is	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
FREE	O
!	O

My	O
academic	O
counselor	B-ASP
was	O
nearly	O
non-existent	O
;	O
emails	O
generally	O
went	O
unanswered	O
or	O
had	O
a	O
generic	O
response	O
referring	O
to	O
documents	O
kept	O
on	O
the	O
website	O

With	O
DeVry	B-ASP
you	O
get	O
high	O
cost	O
and	O
not	O
much	O
in	O
return	O
.	O

The	O
technician	B-ASP
even	O
helped	O
me	O
walk	O
thru	O
the	O
application	O
to	O
make	O
sure	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
any	O
more	O
technical	O
issues	O

E-Trade	B-ASP
also	O
lets	O
you	O
personalize	O
your	O
Web	B-ASP

with	O
its	O
mix	O
of	O
investment	O

your	O

Another	O
pitfall	O
of	O
Egroups	B-ASP
is	O
their	O
tech	B-ASP
support	I-ASP
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
instructors	B-ASP
that	O
appear	O
unqualified	O
to	O
teach	O
at	O
a	O
college-level	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
plus	O
side	O
,	O
E*Trade	B-ASP
is	O
getting	O
into	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
side	O
areas	O
that	O
might	O
prove	O
to	O
be	O
of	O
benefit	O
to	O
its	O
client	O
base	O

My	O
main	O
complaint	O
with	O
UMUC	B-ASP
is	O
the	O
disorganization	O
among	O
their	O
administration	B-ASP
.	O

I	O
highly	O
don't	O
reccomend	O
this	O
school	B-ASP
.	O

If	O
you	O
are	O
on	O
a	O
fast	O
connection	O
,	O
this	O
really	O
doesn't	O
matter	O
at	O
all	O
since	O
ETrade	B-ASP
has	O
fast	O
loading	O
pages	B-ASP

I	O
like	O
their	O
research	B-ASP
,	O
and	O
though	O
I	O
am	O
often	O
baffled	O
by	O
technical	O
analysis	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
quite	O
easy	O
to	O
access	O
and	O
I'm	O
learning	O
more	O
and	O
more	O
as	O
I	O
go	O

This	O

Online	B-ASP
schooling	I-ASP
isn't	O
for	O
everyone	O
.	O

Although	O
E*Trade	B-ASP
may	O
be	O
cheaper	O
than	O
seeking	O
the	O
services	O
of	O
a	O
professional	O
broker	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
at	O
times	O
led	O
to	O
question	O
whether	O
the	O
discount	O
is	O
really	O
worth	O
the	O
hassle	O
.	O

Every	O
EGroup	B-ASP
that	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
involved	O

I	O
and	O
a	O
few	O

in	O
a	O
little	O
email	O

of	O
our	O
own	O
and	O
my	O
friend	O
who	O
knew	O
about	O

figured	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
easier	O
if	O
we	O
joined	O

However	O
,	O
at	O
Capella	B-ASP
you	O
actually	O
have	O
the	O
chance	O
to	O

what	O
YOU	O

My	O
review	O
of	O
E*Trade	B-ASP
is	O
mixed	O
.	O

I	O
generally	O
find	O
the	O
work	B-ASP
and	O
reading	B-ASP
to	O
be	O
moderately	O
challenging	O
,	O
and	O
enjoy	O
doing	O
most	O
of	O
it	O
.	O

The	O
cost	B-ASP
of	O
the	O
education	B-ASP
is	O
expensive	O
.	O

Otherwise	O
,	O
E*Trade	B-ASP
has	O
good	O
fundamentals	B-ASP
at	O
its	O
site	O
.	O

CTU	B-ASP
has	O
a	O
north	O
central	O
regional	O
accreditation	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
suppose	O
you	O
know	O
better	O
that	O
the	O
accreditation	O
board	O
?	O

The	O
account	O
setup	B-ASP
was	O
relatively	O
straightforward	O
,	O
though	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
print	O
and	O
mail	O
the	O
application	O
because	O
they	O
would	O
not	O
accept	O
it	O
on-line	O
then	O
.	O

Now	O
,	O
both	O
services	B-ASP
offer	O
the	O
same	O
service	O
for	O
the	O
same	O
great	O

Witter	O
,	O
SureTrade	O
,	O
and	O
Wit	O
Capital	O
;	O
I	O
can	O
honestly	O
say	O
that	O
E*Trade	B-ASP
is	O
the	O
absolute	O
worst	O
of	O
the	O
five	O
.	O

The	O
calendar	B-ASP
feature	O
is	O
good	O
but	O
not	O
excellent	O
.	O

I’m	O
very	O
pleased	O
with	O
the	O
course	B-ASP
.	O

I	O
can	O
say	O
that	O
studying	O
in	O
the	O
University	B-ASP
of	O
Phoenix	B-ASP
Online	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
great	O
experience	O

Their	O
customer	B-ASP
service	I-ASP
is	O
the	O
worst	O
I	O
have	O
ever	O
encountered	O
.	O

have	O
attempted	O
to	O
create	O
sites	O
like	O
this	O

eCircles	B-ASP
has	O
perfected	O
it	O
with	O
creating	O
a	O
visually	O
stimulating	O
interface	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
end	O
result	O
is	O
that	O
we	O
get	O
instructors	B-ASP
filling	O
in	O
for	O
courses	O
that	O
ned	O
to	O
be	O
taught	O
,	O
but	O
who	O
have	O
less	O

I’m	O
now	O
approaching	O
the	O
end	O
of	O
my	O
MBA	O

with	O
CTU	B-ASP

The	O
site	B-ASP
itself	O
is	O
a	O
little	O
slow	O
,	O
but	O
not	O
overly	O
so	O
.	O

Unfortunately	O
,	O
almost	O
all	O
websites	O
have	O
advertising	O
now	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
ads	B-ASP
on	O
E*Trade's	B-ASP

are	O
very	O
unobtrusive	O
.	O

First	O
and	O
foremost	O
,	O
let	O
me	O
say	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
Egroups/ONElist	B-ASP
is	O
the	O
best	O
email	O

on	O
the	O

Overall	O

I	O
considered	O
our	O

to	O
be	O
incompetent	O

indifferent	O

and	O
unprofessional	O

It	O
turned	O

that	O

The	O
trade	O

are	O
high	O
:	O
19.95	O
for	O
NASDAQ	O
is	O
just	O
too	O
high	O
in	O
comparison	O
with	O
the	O
other	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
group	B-ASP
that	O
showed	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
same	O
Monday	O
that	O
a	O
paper	O
was	O
due	O

expected	O

to	O

it	O

If	O
there	O
is	O
any	O
misstatement	O
of	O
fact	O
here	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
probably	O
because	O
eGroups	B-ASP
has	O
done	O
a	O
terrible	O
job	O
of	O
informing	O
listowners	O
of	O
what's	O
up	O

I	O
guess	O
what	O
I	O
find	O
most	O
depressing	O
is	O
the	O
thought	O
of	O
people	O
pursuing	O
their	O
undergraduate	O
degrees	O
at	O
UMUC	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
new	O
eGroups	B-ASP
is	O
a	O
lot	O
more	O
aesthetically	O
pleasing	O
and	O
makes	O
it	O
even	O
easier	O
for	O
someone	O
to	O
find	O
what	O
they	O
need	O
.	O

The	O
course	O
texts	B-ASP
were	O
too	O
basic	O

and	O
for	O
intro	O

students	O
,	O
I	O
expected	O
something	O
more	O
challenging	O
form	O
the	O
UMUC	O
experience	O
.	O

Another	O
bad	O
point	O
is	O
that	O
E*Trade	B-ASP
is	O
falling	O
behind	O
with	O
offering	O
such	O
services	O
as	O

a	O
lot	O

very	O
active	O

looks	O

eGroups	O
had	O
.	O

In	O
fact	O
,	O
it's	O
been	O
three	O
days	O
now	O
and	O
I'm	O
still	O
waiting	O
for	O
them	B-ASP
to	O
fix	O
this	O
problem	O
.	O

Generally	O
,	O
I	O
recommend	O
Egroups	B-ASP
to	O
anyone	O
interested	O
in	O
anything	O
they	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
share	O
with	O
others	O
.	O

I've	O
found	O
that	O
egroups	B-ASP
is	O
very	O
good	O
because	O
,	O
if	O
you	O
run	O
a	O
list	O
,	O
it	O
takes	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
burden	O
of	O
managing	O
a	O
list	O
away	O
.	O

My	O
summary	O
of	O
the	O
school	B-ASP
is	O
that	O
you	O
get	O
what	O
you	O
put	O
in	O
,	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
ample	O
opportunity	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
lot	O
out	O
.	O

So	O
E-Trade	B-ASP
not	O
only	O
get	O
a	O
poor	O
rating	O
for	O
customer	B-ASP
service	I-ASP
,	O
they	O
also	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
looking	O
for	O
any	O
way	O
to	O
skim	O
a	O
pick	O
the	O
pockets	O
of	O
its	O
customers	O
.	O

He	O
also	O
explained	O
that	O
we	O
had	O
day	O
plus	O
three	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
check	O
for	O
$5894.95	O
to	O

As	O
a	O
hiring	O
manager	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
lean	O
more	O
toward	O
someone	O
with	O
a	O
degree	O
from	O
University	B-ASP
of	I-ASP
Phoenix	I-ASP
than	O
one	O
from	O
a	O
state	O
university	O

And	O
it	O
is	O
easy	O
to	O
join	O
an	O
egroup	B-ASP

I've	O
rated	O
the	O
professors	B-ASP
and	O
staff	B-ASP
in	O
the	O
high	O
90%	O

Egroups	B-ASP
is	O
a	O
wonderful	O
way	O
to	O
keep	O
in	O

with	O
friends	O

for	O
certain	O

however	O
it	O

also	O
a	O
great	O
place	O
to	O
meet	O
other	O

with	O
similar	O

Problem	O
is	O
this	O
,	O
half	O
the	O
time	O
the	O
books	B-ASP
are	O
not	O
avaliable	O
,	O
you	O
need	O
to	O

everytime	O
you	O

the	O

half	O
the	O

are	O
missing	O

I	O
haven't	O
had	O
any	O

and	O
if	O
I	O
forget	O
my	O

they	O
send	O

only	O

now	O

I	O
asked	O
for	O

to	O
compensate	O
for	O
their	O

of	O

The	O
electronic	B-ASP
books	I-ASP
you	O
are	O
forced	O
to	O
purchase	O
are	O
way	O
over	O
priced	O
and	O
very	O
hard	O
to	O
use	O
effectively	O
.	O

As	O
I	O
said	O
earlier	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
one	O
thing	O
that	O
makes	O
EGroups	B-ASP
better	O
then	O

At	O

I	O
can't	O
even	O

a	O

Seriously	O
it	O
is	O
not	O

the	O

over	O

that	O
are	O

the	O

One	O
night	O
online	O
all	O
of	O
these	O
students	B-ASP
ganged	O
up	O
on	O
me	O
about	O
their	O
grades	O
.	O

Overall	O
,	O
i'm	O
left	O
with	O
having	O
doubts	O
of	O
even	O
attending	O
this	O
school	B-ASP
because	O
I	O
haven't	O
even	O
started	O
attending	O
classes	O
yet	O
and	O
i'm	O
already	O
having	O
this	O
much	O
trouble	O
and	O
its	O
causing	O
so	O
much	O
stress	O
.	O

Just	O
sign	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
very	O
,	O
very	O
short	O
registration	B-ASP
form	I-ASP

The	O
fact	O
I	O
was	O
paid	O
$75	O
for	O
opening	O
the	O
account	O
certainly	O
helped	O
my	O
decision	O
to	O
use	O
E*TRADE	B-ASP
services	O
.	O

Those	O
that	O
complain	O
the	O
most	O
are	O
often	O
people	B-ASP
who	O
attended	O
other	O
b-schools	O
and	O
think	O
graduates	O
from	O
UoP	B-ASP
are	O
slackers	O
and	O
somehow	O
lowering	O
standards	O
overall	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
found	O
supportive	O
people	B-ASP
who	O
are	O
there	O
for	O
me	O
when	O
I	O
need	O
them	O
.	O

Another	O
problem	O
with	O
E*Trade	B-ASP
is	O
their	O
option	B-ASP
chains	I-ASP
don't	O
have	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
options	O
that	O
are	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
one	O
of	O

my	O
B.A	O

both	O

I've	O
had	O

Yes	O
,	O
this	O
was	O
a	O
$	O
$5894.95	O
lesson	O
to	O
learn	O
and	O
it	O
has	O
caused	O
great	O
anguish	O
and	O
frustration	O
,	O
especially	O
in	O
my	O
contacts	O
with	O
E*trade	B-ASP
.	O

I	O
thought	O
the	O
courses	B-ASP
would	O
be	O
more	O
challenging	O
,	O
but	O
because	O
anyone	O
can	O
enroll	O
in	O
a	O
course	O
,	O
the	O
instructors	O
have	O
to	O
dumb	O
it	O
down	O
so	O
everyone	O
can	O
enjoy	O
.	O

I	O
just	O
wanted	O
to	O
give	O
you	O
an	O
idea	O
of	O
how	O
diverse	O
the	O
groups	B-ASP
are	O
.	O

I	O
manage	O
a	O
couple	O
lists	O
through	O
egroups	B-ASP
and	O
I	O
really	O
like	O
the	O
options	O
they	O
offer	O
to	O

managers	O

The	O
individual	O
projects	B-ASP
,	O
often	O
based	O
on	O
simulations	O
,	O
are	O
pertinent	O
to	O
the	O
topic	O
but	O
require	O
you	O
to	O
really	O
think	O
about	O
handling	O
situations	O
.	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
recommend	O
the	O
University	B-ASP
of	I-ASP
Phoenix	I-ASP
to	O
anyone	O
that	O
is	O
seriously	O

I	O
work	O
40-50	O

can't	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O

many	O

about	O

where	O
my	O

is	O
going	O

I	O

make	O
a	O
complaint	O
against	O
a	O

Paypal	B-ASP

The	O
positive	O
side	O

that	O

too	O
felt	O

does	O
the	O
job	O
for	O
a	O
reasonable	O

I	O
think	O
they	O
could	O
do	O
better	O

The	O

I	O
say	O
sad	O

because	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
this	O

ruined	O
what	O

can't	O
fool	O
me	O

they	O

the	O

During	O
the	O

is	O
an	O
effective	O
communication	O
tool	O
for	O
sharing	O
ideas	O

but	O
the	O
interface	B-ASP

due	O
to	O
the	O
inherent	O
slowness	O
of	O
its	O
bulletin	B-ASP

format	I-ASP

I	O
was	O
told	O
by	O
the	O

that	O

was	O
too	O
many	O
A's	B-ASP
in	O
my	O

never	O

I	O
only	O
check	O

In	O
my	O
view	O
the	O
sole	O
purpose	O
of	O
this	O
institution	B-ASP
is	O
to	O
collect	O
(	O
exorbitant	O
)	O
tuition	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
definitely	O
like	O
one	O
feature	O
of	O

Lately	O

I	O

things	O
about	O

Things	B-ASP
that	O
are	O
great	O
about	O
being	O
a	O

that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
somewhat	O
inherent	O
flaw	O
in	O
the	O
Learning	O
Team	O
approach	B-ASP

but	O
in	O
the	O

This	O

There	O
are	O
many	O
groups	B-ASP
with	O
good	O
information	B-ASP
related	O
to	O
illnesses	O
people	O

some	O

can	O

the	O

trials	O

The	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
