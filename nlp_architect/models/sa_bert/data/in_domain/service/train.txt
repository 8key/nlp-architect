at	O

you	O

the	O

I	O

I	O
find	O

that	O

Overview	O
I	O
think	B-ASP
eGroups	O
is	O
a	O
great	O
idea	O

The	O
worst	O
part	O
of	O
the	O
school	B-ASP
is	O
the	O
instructors	O
that	O
just	O
hand	O
out	O
A's	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
very	O
appealing	O
opportunities	O
which	O
initially	O
drew	O
me	O
to	O
E*Trade	B-ASP
was	O
the	O
opportunity	O
to	O
get	O
in	O
on	O
IPO's	B-ASP
.	O

The	O
virtual	B-ASP
campus	I-ASP
and	O
classroom	B-ASP
portal	I-ASP
have	O
been	O
great	O
.	O

There	O
are	O
other	O
on-	O
line	O
brokers	O
that	O
offer	O
a	O
little	O
better	O
prices	O
than	O
this	O
(	O
like	O
Suretrade	O
and	O
Datek	O
)	O
but	O
these	O
prices	B-ASP
are	O
still	O
not	O
too	O
bad	O
.	O

If	O
your	O
considering	O
a	O
online	O
college	O
,	O
I	O
would	O
advise	O
you	O
to	O
stay	O
away	O
from	O
CTU	B-ASP
,	O
too	O
many	O
changes	B-ASP
that	O
are	O
not	O
for	O
the	O
good	O
of	O
the	O

for	O
the	O

to	O

I	O
reccomend	O

quality	B-ASP

I	O

all	O
I	O
can	O

that	O

rigurous	O

you	O
learn	O
a	O

not	O

how	O

were	O
able	O

tell	O

I've	O
attended	O
three	O
large	O
traditional	O
universities	O
and	O
have	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
the	O
eduction	B-ASP
I'm	O
receiving	O
at	O
Cappella	B-ASP
is	O
far	O
superior	O
and	O
much	O
more	O
challenging	O
.	O

There	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
reading	B-ASP
material	I-ASP
and	O
sometimes	O
the	O
work	B-ASP
can	O
be	O
more	O
tedious	O
than	O
challenging	O
.	O

I	O
had	O
a	O
nightmare	O
with	O
Capella	B-ASP
University	I-ASP
.	O

The	O
best	O
thing	O
about	O
E*trade	B-ASP
is	O
the	O
concept	O
of	O
online	O
trading	O
.	O

I	O
personally	O
use	O
eGroups	B-ASP
to	O
run	O
my	O
journal's	O
notification	O
list--it's	O
a	O
small	O
group	O
,	O
but	O
the	O
service	B-ASP
is	O
still	O
remarkable	O
.	O

E*Trade	B-ASP
,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion	O
,	O
is	O
a	O
pathetic	O
operation	O
that	O
relies	O
too	O
much	O
on	O
their	O
site	O
(	O
which	O
is	O
the	O
most	O
complex	O
interface	O
I've	O
ever	O
seen	O
)	O
and	O
not	O
enough	O
on	O
service	O
.	O

It	O
seems	O
to	O
me	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
a	O
very	O
large	O
margin	O
of	O
opinion	O
about	O
CTU	B-ASP
.	O

Any	O
time	O
there's	O
major	O
action	O
in	O
the	O
market	O
,	O
getting	O
online	O
is	O
a	O
nightmare	O
through	O
Etrade	B-ASP

However	O
,	O
this	O
con	O
can	O
be	O
substantially	O
diminished	O
by	O
the	O
faster	O
executions	B-ASP
which	O
Etrade	B-ASP
offers	O

Once	O
you're	O

Your	O

get	O
called	O
off	O

many	O

Other	O

might	O
be	O
a	O
little	O
quicker	O
to	O
ask	O
you	O
to	O
liquidate	O
or	O
put	O
mor	O
money	O
in	O
but	O
Etrade	B-ASP
has	O
been	O
very	O
good	O
with	O
that	O
.	O

I	O
guess	O
what	O
I'm	O
saying	O
is	O
that	O
with	O
all	O
of	O
the	O
great	O
things	O
that	O
Etrade	B-ASP
offers	O
,	O
their	O
customer	B-ASP
service	I-ASP
is	O
just	O
down	O
right	O
lousy	O

I	O
would	O
recommend	O
Etrade	B-ASP
to	O
anyone	O
that	O
is	O
looking	O
for	O
an	O
online	O

that	O

thing	O
--	O
after	O

of	O
the	O

The	O

the	O

The	O
best	O

The	O

They've	O

not	O
everyone	O

I'll	O
use	O
it	O

clearly	O
that	O
price	B-ASP
is	O
too	O
high	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
fast-turnover	O

I	O
enjoyed	O
the	O

very	O
much	O
and	O
learned	O
a	O
lot	O

I	O
will	O
say	O
,	O
I	O
often	O
did	O
miss	O
the	O
physical	B-ASP

(	O

by	O
the	O

By	O
shirking	O

antagonizing	O
many	O
of	O

the	O
myopic	O
E-Trade	B-ASP

demonstrated	O
bad	O

business	B-ASP

that	O
will	O
eventually	O
ruin	O
E-Trade's	O

But	O
ever	O
since	O
I've	O
opened	O
my	O
account	O
~Jan	O
'99	O
,	O
their	O
web	B-ASP
site	I-ASP
often	O
states	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
problems	O
with	O
the	O

at	O
that	O
time	O

Once	O
your	O

set	O
up	O

you	O
have	O
many	O

open	O
to	O
you	O
by	O

your	O

This	O
egroup	B-ASP
is	O
CHANGING	O
my	O
home	O
to	O
a	O
more	O
organized	O
place	O
!	O

The	O
professors	B-ASP
are	O
more	O
of	O
a	O
conversation	O
mediator	O
among	O
the	O
students	O
than	O
an	O
actual	O
professor	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
called	O
countless	O
times	O
to	O
managers	B-ASP
and	O
even	O
the	O
director	O
of	B-ASP

But	O
last	O
week	O
I	O
heard	O
an	O
E-Trade	O

that	O
was	O
offering	O
two	O
Tina	O

that	O
opens	O

these	O

so	O
E-Trade	B-ASP
is	O
pocketing	O
the	O
difference	O

Conclusion	O
E-Trade	B-ASP
customer	I-ASP

big	O
time	O

I	O
will	O
not	O
simply	O

I	O
will	O

more	O
heavily	O

my	O

me	O

such	O

My	O
feeling	O
is	O
that	O

made	O
a	O

of	O

Yahoo	O
is	O
happy	O

Oh	O

I	O
got	O
to	O

that	O
the	O

they	O

UMUC	B-ASP
has	O
a	O

In	O

I	O

Most	O
of	O
the	O

that	O

too	O
lazy	O
to	O

want	O
more	O
down	O

I've	O
always	O
been	O
pretty	O
dubious	O
about	O
the	O
concept	O
of	O

their	O

reading	O
the	O

has	O
done	O
nothing	O
at	O
all	O
to	O
dissuade	O
me	O
from	O
that	O
opinion	O

UMUC	B-ASP
should	O
be	O
ashamed	O

where	O
the	O

that	O

made	O
my	O

The	O

E-Trade	B-ASP
even	O

I	O
also	O
feel	O
the	O
price	B-ASP
to	O
do	O

14.99	O

very	O

unless	O

The	O
only	O
thing	O
that	O
I	O

is	O
that	O
some	O

to	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O

out	O
of	O

for	O

one	O

The	O
final	O
advantage	O
I've	O
seen	O
from	O
E*Trade	B-ASP

they're	O
willing	O
to	O

point	O
is	O

if	O
you've	O
got	O
an	O

you'll	O
likely	O
find	O
a	O

Everyone	B-ASP

I	O

I	O
need	O
and	O
E-Trade	B-ASP
does	O
that	O

Additionally	O

I	O
seemed	O
to	O

I	O
found	O
it	O

easier	O
to	O

The	O
system	B-ASP
itself	O
runs	O
a	O
bit	O
slower	O
than	O
most	O

but	O
most	O
people	O
don't	O
understand	O
that	O
that's	O
because	O
of	O

As	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
case	O
with	O
every	O

Five	O
years	O

I	O

When	O
you	O
met	O

ask	O
them	O
just	O
what	O
their	O

were	O
before	O
they	O
completed	O
their	O

often	O

you	O
will	O

that	O

have	O
almost	O
no	O
real	O

This	O

and	O
not	O
have	O

I	O
found	O
that	O
EGroups	B-ASP
is	O
basically	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
Yahoo	O

with	O
a	O
few	O
less	O

Now	O
,	O
here's	O
where	O
Yahoo	B-ASP

screwed	O
it	O
up	O
when	O

I	O
love	O

will	O
continue	O
from	O
there	O
all	O

the	O

and	O
it's	O
very	O
easy	O
to	O
see	O
why	O

The	O
premise	B-ASP
is	O
simple	O
:	O
a	O
Yahoo	O
Group	O
is	O
formed	O
by	O
someone	O
to	O
cover	O
a	O
topic	O
of	O

What	O
I	O
like	O
about	O
capella	B-ASP
is	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
rapidly	O
working	O
to	O
increase	O
their	O
prestige	O
.	O

People	O
you	O
invite	O
can	O
invite	O

the	O
possibilities	O
for	O

are	O
great	O
if	O
you	O

an	O

After	O
having	O
done	O
this	O
about	O
50	O
times	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
Etrade	B-ASP
executes	O
its	O
orders	O
much	O
faster	O
than	O
Datek	O
.	O

I	O
chose	O
E-Trade	B-ASP
initially	O
because	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
leaders	O
in	O
online	O
trading	O
,	O
they	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
good	O
research	B-ASP
,	O
and	O
their	O
prices	B-ASP
weren't	O
too	O
bad	O
either	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
got	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
Etrades	O
customer	B-ASP
service	I-ASP
is	O
not	O
up	O
to	O
par	O
.	O

I	O
recently	O
was	O
involved	O
in	O
a	O
conversation	O
at	O
work	O
where	O
a	O
Capella	O
PH	O
D	O
student	O
was	O
so	O
ashamed	O
of	O
the	O
school	B-ASP
for	O
his	O
"	O
in	O
progress	O
"	O
degree	O
that	O
he	O
did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
mention	O
the	O

of	O
the	O
institution	O
to	O
the	O

This	O

very	O

of	O
the	O

things	O
about	O

the	O
beauty	O
of	O
it	O
is	O
that	O
there	O
are	O

on	O
lots	O
of	O
stuff	O

I	O
opened	O
my	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
total	O
joke	O
of	O
a	O
school	B-ASP

My	O
financial	O
counselor	B-ASP
and	O
her	O

dropped	O

when	O
I	O
called	O
to	O

with	O
another	O

or	O

they	O
put	O
me	O
on	O

for	O
25	O

My	O
first	O
complaint	O
is	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
opened	O
the	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
notice	O
that	O
ETRADE	B-ASP

so	O
I	O
called	O
their	O

The	O
commission	B-ASP
fee	I-ASP

For	O
those	O
who	O
have	O
that	O
mindset	O
about	O
Capella	B-ASP
,	O
you	O
need	O
to	O
be	O
put	O
away	O
for	O
insanity	O
(	O

for	O
frivolous	O
motivations	O
)	O

As	O
a	O
CTU	O

I	O
can	O
say	O
that	O
CTU	B-ASP
is	O
on	O
par	O
with	O
any	O
traditional	O
school	O
in	O
the	O
country	O

I	O

I	O
can	O
say	O
that	O
the	O

it	O

I	O
signed	O

that	O

The	O

really	O

The	O
only	O
problem	O
I	O

was	O
the	O
fact	O
that	O

The	O
thing	O
about	O
CTU	B-ASP
that	O
people	O
do	O

is	O
that	O

Devry	B-ASP
is	O
an	O
incredibly	O

school	O
that	O
has	O
taught	O
me	O
more	O
in	O
my	O
first	O
two	O

than	O
I	O
have	O
learned	O
from	O
23	O
years	O
of	O

It	O
wasn't	O
until	O

that	O
I	O
realized	O
just	O
how	O
important	O
this	O

would	O
be	O

But	O
I	O
use	O
E*Trade	B-ASP
quite	O
a	O
