seated	O
for	O
40	O

the	O
three	O
of	O
us	O
were	O
squished	O
into	O
a	O
small	O
2-person	B-ASP

The	O
prices	B-ASP

for	O
the	O
ambience	B-ASP
,	O
and	O
consider	O
the	O
food	B-ASP
just	O
a	O
companion	O
for	O
a	O
trip	O
across	O
the	O
world	O
!	O

The	O
service	O
was	O
poor	O
,	O
restaurant	O
poorly	O
lit	O
,	O
staff	O
not	O
very	O
attentive	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
rather	O
eaten	O
at	O
a	O
Mcdonald	O
's	O
than	O
this	O
joint	O
.	O

Have	O
a	O
mojito	B-ASP
and	O
sit	O
in	O
the	O
back	B-ASP
patio	I-ASP

The	O
food	B-ASP
is	O
so	O
cheap	O
and	O
the	O
waiters	B-ASP
are	O
nice	O
.	O

The	O
staff	B-ASP
is	O
incredibly	O
helpful	O
and	O
attentive	O

I	O
have	O
never	O
before	O
eaten	O
40	O
pieces	O
of	O
relatively	O
good	O
nigiri	B-ASP

I	O
do	O
suggest	O
to	O
ask	O
to	O
be	O
seated	O
upstairs	B-ASP
if	O
you	O
are	O
looking	O
to	O
be	O
a	O

This	O

The	O
ambience	B-ASP
is	O
pretty	O
and	O
nice	O
for	O

so	O
a	O
casual	O
lunch	B-ASP
here	O
would	O
probably	O
be	O
best	O
